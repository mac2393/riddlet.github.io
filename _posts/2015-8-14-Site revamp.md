Only a minor update this time. I instead opted to spend my time tweaking the layout of the site a little bit. There's still a couple of things I'd like to change, but it's in a good place for now.

Questions of the week:

- How do you extract only the main body of text from a diverse group of webpages (i.e. not the comments or ads or headers or...)

*Answer* - [goose-extractor](https://github.com/grangier/python-goose)

- Why does this prestigious university not have a system in place for hosting and sharing data in an efficient, reliable, and secure way?

*Answer* - I have no idea. Surely other research institutions don't have this problem, do they?

-  What's the best way to estimate irregularly spaced longitudinal outcomes as a function of irregularly spaced text observations interacting with some grouping variables?

*Answer* - In progress
