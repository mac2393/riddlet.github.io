title: First post-doc pub
---

My team and I finished off the revisions for the first publication to come out of the work I've been doing as a post-doc. It's a modest contribution to the literature - as far as we know, it's the first large-scale investigations of the content of values affirmations. Nothing really earth-shaking, but I think it's a fine piece of work and I'm happy with it. It's a great starting point, and we're already building on the work contained here. Interested parties can hear more about what we've done since at our [APS symposium](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/convention/2015-convention-program#.VUzO89pVhBd) in two weeks.  Our group has two of the four talks, and I'm eager to share the stage with [Andrew Schwartz](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hansens/) and [Suresh Naidu](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~snaidu/) in addition to [Smaranda](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smara/).  Plus, we managed to snag James Pennebaker for a discussant.  It should be an interesting set of talks. 

Anyway, [here's](/../docs/edm_2015.pdf) the paper. I'll present it at the [Educational Data Mining](http://www.educationaldatamining.org/EDM2015/) conference in June, and it will be published in the conference proceedings.
