I'm a postdoc working with the [LIRSM lab](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/vpvaughns/) and [CCLS](ccls.columbia.edu) at Columbia University. I'm a computational social scientist interested in psychology, human-computer interaction, and how psychological processes manifest themselves in written text.
