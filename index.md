I'm a postdoc working with the [LIRSM lab](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/vpvaughns/) and [CCLS](ccls.columbia.edu) at Columbia University. I'm interested in intergroup interactions and how psychological processes manifest themselves in written text. To study these issues, I blend traditional lab-based psychological research methods with techniques from computer science.
