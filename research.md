Broadly, I'm interested in applying computational approaches to social questions. My data come from lab studies, field studies, and web-based observational research.

### How can we characterize how people interact with their devices?

Our digital devices are an increasingly a prominent part of our daily lives, with [some work](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6043/776.abstract) suggesting that we even treat them as extensions of our selves. I've conducted basic research investigating properties about the relationship between us and our devices, including how we demarcate internal representations into the self and not-the-self and measuring our sensitivity to temporal properties of dynamic displays.

### Diversity in human-computer interaction

Historically, computers have been built and used by predominantly wealthy, white males. Although this is changing, increasing the representation of women and minorities within STEM fields will ensure that these machines are built with a broad class of people in mind. To this end, I've been using computational techniques to mine the content and structure of a written academic intervention known as a values-affirmation that has been shown to improve educational outcomes for women and minorities in STEM fields especially. The objective with this work is to show how and why this intervention works, and to use what we learn to attempt to improve the intervention or better target those who could benefit the most from it.

### How can digital traces of behavior inform psychological theory and research?

Observational research has long been a key pillar of psychological work, but despite the amount of behavioral data documented digitally, psychologists have been slow to use this vast resource. Here, I am exploring specific aspects of social cognition as manifested digitally, with plans to leverage this work into robust, lab-based paradigms.
