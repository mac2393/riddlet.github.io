title: "Communicating objectives"

I've been thinking a bit more about what the objectives of publication are and what this might suggest about the process.  I think that there are three major objectives for scientists.

1.  Document our empirical findings
2.  Document the evolution of our ideas
3.  Efficiently allocate attention to ideas and results which best fit the ideals of the scientific community.

Clearly, the set of objectives changes a little bit if we consider how to publicize results outside of the scientific bubble, but as a starting point, let's stay within our little community.  Looking at the three points above, the third one seems a bit different from the first two.

####Documenting Empirical Findings####
This objective should be self-evidently important.  When we conduct research, we absolutely must inform the rest of the field about what we find.  If this didn't happen, every scientist would be an island unto himself or herself, and we really wouldn't get anywhere.  

####Documenting the Evolution of Ideas####
This happens to some degree already, but not enough.  If you're working in a field like psychology, where your theory about underlying psychological constructs, processes, and mechanisms shifts over time (and it should!), it's important to document how these changes occur, and what leads you to shift your view.  Too frequently, theory and ideas contained in published papers (especially if they're highly cited) are seen as concrete and immutable.  I think if the documentation of this process was more transparent, then we wouldn't fall victim to this problem of viewing ideas as static.

Regardless, in addition to communicating empirical work, the communication of ideas and their evolution not only gives a history of an individual's work, but allows other researchers to direct their own work in a way which is informed by the work of others.  You might or might not buy into the ideas that others have, but you shouldn't ignore them entirely when conducting your own work.

####Efficiently allocating attention####
