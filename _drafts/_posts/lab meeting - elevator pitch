lab meeting - elevator pitch

1. rough talk to each other
2. collectively outline a good pitch structure
3. write down a draft, & deliver it to the other person.
4. receive comments

what worked:
collective outlining.

what didn't
groups of two is less than ideal - 3 would be better
make sure to tell people to pay attention to likes and dislikes
This is maybe too much for a one hour meeting
