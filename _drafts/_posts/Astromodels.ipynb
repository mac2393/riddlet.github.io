      "In the last post, I described my efforts at grabbing some data from a web site. Specifically, I scraped daily horoscopes from NYpost for a period of about a year and a half. While I have an admittedly poor understanding of astrology, I do know that each astrological sign is supposed confer some unique dispositional qualities to anyone born under that sign. If that's true, then we would expect that the astrological readings would reflect the uniqueness of each sign. To be more explicit, the language found in a horoscope for each sign should carry some information about which sign it is most likely to belong to.\n",

      "Friedman, Tibshirani & Hastie, in their widely used text *The Elements of Statistical Learning* describe machine learning algorithms with an analogy that I think works pretty well. The compare a supervised learning algorithm to a student in a classroom. For the student to learn something, the teacher presents him or her with some example problems along with the answers. The student learns the relationship between the problems and answers, and then applies what it has learned to some new problems, attempting to guess the correct answer.\n",
      "\n",
