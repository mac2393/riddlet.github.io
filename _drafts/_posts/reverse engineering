Don't do it.

Situation: You've got some summary scores (e.g. means) for a dataset. You don't know what variables in the original data went into those summary scores, but you're confident the information is there.

I spent two days this week trying to figure out a way to computationally reverse-engineer the process that lead to the summary scores in question. Brute-forcing this wont work, because if you've got even a moderately sized set of variables to choose from and more than a few variables that could make up the score, then you're going to approach really big numbers really really quickly.
