0|For some reason you appear reluctant to accept an offer of assistance from a friend or work colleague. According to the planets you are right to be suspicious, so listen to your sixth sense and do only what it tells you.|12-01-2013|pisces
1|It may appear as if you are the only one making sacrifices for a relationship but the planets warn you are not seeing the situation clearly. Don’t start complaining or you may lose the one person who makes your world a better place.|12-02-2013|pisces
2|You are being far too pessimistic about your chances. In all things there is a natural ebb and flow and if you are on the down side of the curve at the moment you are sure to be on the up again by the end of the week.|12-03-2013|pisces
3|The only thing to fear is fear itself, so put your doubts behind you and plunge headlong into the unknown. That might not sound like a typically Taurus thing to do but, seriously, what have you got to lose? Take a chance.|12-04-2013|pisces
4|What you focus your attention on today will seem more important than it really is, so make sure you focus on positive things. Your mind is a powerful tool and can create happiness as easily as it creates sadness. Remember that. |12-05-2013|pisces
5|Too often in the past you have held back while those with considerably less talent have achieved the kind of success that should have been yours. It’s time to shed your inhibitions and let the world see what a star you really are.|12-06-2013|pisces
6|You won’t lack for confidence today but you may lack for common sense, so don’t push your luck too far. On the work front, especially, you need to be aware that certain people do not have your best interests at heart.|12-07-2013|pisces
7|Keep your eye on money matters and business issues and make sure you are not being duped by people who would quite happily get rich at your expense. It would be nice if everyone was as honest as you but the fact is they’re not.|12-08-2013|pisces
8|There is a lot of pressure on you at the moment, the sort that would make other people crack. But you’re not other people, you’re a Taurus, and giving in and giving up are not in your nature. What’s the worst that can happen? You can handle it.|12-09-2013|pisces
9|Be careful what you say if someone comes to you for advice. Make sure what you tell them comes from your own experience and is not something you picked up from an unreliable source. If you don’t know the answer, just say so.|12-10-2013|pisces
10|If you need to get something finished you had better step on the gas. Mars in the work area of your chart will boost your energy levels but you won’t get anywhere worth going unless you are motivated. Remind yourself what it’s all for.|12-11-2013|pisces
11|It may at times seem as if you are not making much progress but in a matter of days there will be clear signs that you are on the verge of a major breakthrough. Keep looking ahead and keep doing what makes you feel good.|12-12-2013|pisces
12|Expect your workload to increase a lot over the next 24 hours. That may not sound like good news but at least it shows that important people trust you to get the job done. Looks like you’re the only one they can rely on.|12-13-2013|pisces
13|Don’t let your tendency to fear the worst get out of hand and spoil what otherwise promises to be a good weekend. If anxiety starts to bite just stop, count to ten, and remind yourself of all the things you have to be thankful for.|12-14-2013|pisces
14|Your money situation looks worse than it really is, so resist the urge to make major changes. Yes, cutbacks of some kind will be necessary in the long-term but now is not the best time to start them as you are not thinking straight.|12-15-2013|pisces
15|Speak up if you have something important to say but make sure you listen too because the feedback you get could be invaluable. Also, someone you meet on your travels will come up with an idea that you take to immediately|12-16-2013|pisces
16|You may feel compelled to accept what is being offered but if you are not happy with the terms you must speak up or there will be trouble further down the line. You are not being selfish by holding out for more. Do what’s best for you.|12-17-2013|pisces
17|You will have to do something that makes you unpopular but if you don’t do it now you may have to do something twice as bad later on. Put duty before pleasure and make sure you are on top of your workload.|12-18-2013|pisces
18|You may resent having to pay for something you think you should get for free but if you make a scene you may end up paying even more. Don’t be such a miser. Put your hand in your pocket. It’s only money after all.|12-19-2013|pisces
19|If you find yourself up against a tough opponent today you should back off and live to fight another day. The planets warn this is a battle you cannot win and if you cannot win then the only sensible course is to withdraw, for now.|12-20-2013|pisces
20|This is a good time for affairs of the heart and if you are in the market for love you might just meet someone who floats your boat. However, the planets warn it won’t be all plain sailing, so be ready to brave a few storms.|12-21-2013|pisces
21|Make quick work of any money matters or business issues that have to be dealt with, then turn your attention to having fun with your friends. Travel of one sort or another is on the cards over the next few weeks, so start packing.|12-22-2013|pisces
22|This is a fortunate time of year for you, so why the feeling of impending doom? Whatever it is that is making you jittery put it out of your mind because it does not have the power to hurt you. Work is the best remedy for worry.|12-23-2013|pisces
23|You will handle anything and everything life throws at you with grace and style. The planets endow you with limitless self-confidence and the kind of faith that moves mountains. Make the most of it – and make your mark on the world.|12-24-2013|pisces
24|It will pay you to be skeptical about what you are told today, especially if the person who is doing the telling is a rival of some sort. The more they assure you there is nothing to worry about the more you should check for yourself.|12-25-2013|pisces
25|You need a change of perspective and a change of direction and the planets will see that you get it. But don’t worry: you will like what the next few weeks bring your way very much indeed. Be positive and welcome new opportunities.|12-26-2013|pisces
26|This promises to be a special day for you, even more so if you are socializing or traveling. It is also a good day to patch things up romantically. Whatever problems you had in the past put them behind you and move on.|12-27-2013|pisces
27|You are about to be made an offer you won’t want to refuse but some individuals will go out of their way to persuade you that it’s not in your interests. Don’t listen to them. They are jealous because you are attracting so much good fortune.|12-28-2013|pisces
28|The Sun in Capricorn gives your confidence a boost but confidence alone won’t get you where you want to go. The approaching new moon will remind you that no matter how determined you may be you still need powerful friends.|12-30-2013|pisces
29|Something will happen today that others think is of mega-importance. You, however, can see the situation for what it truly is: just another minor drama in a long line of minor dramas. It’s not worth getting worked up about. |12-31-2013|pisces
30|There is nothing you cannot do and no one you cannot impress. Today’s new moon in Capricorn means not only that you are full of confidence but that friends, colleagues and loved ones will go out of their way to assist you too.|01-01-2014|pisces
31|Cosmic activity in the work and well being area of your chart warns youmust be careful not to over do it today. Youmay have a thousand and one things to do but you won’t get them all done at once. There’s always tomorrow.|01-02-2014|pisces
32|The planets will bring to light a solution to a personal or professional problem you thought was here to stay. You should know by now that nothing is impossible: Everything worth knowing is revealed over time, so be patient.|01-03-2014|pisces
33|Minor disputes could escalate into major disagreements over the next 48 hours, so try not to react emotionally to what you see or hear. No matter what happens, at home or at work, keep telling yourself it’s not nearly as bad as it looks.|01-04-2014|pisces
34|This is a great time to be on the move, for business or for pleasure. The more people you meet the more likely it is you will learn something to your advantage. Contacts with unusual people could be especially profitable this week.|01-05-2014|pisces
35|A relationship that has fallen into a rut can be spiced up again but it won’t happen if you keep looking back to the past. Once you accept that it will never be the way it was you can start making it even better for the future.|01-06-2014|pisces
36|You seem to think the worst is going to happen. You seem to think the sky is going to fall on your head. You should know by now that is exactly the sort of thought pattern that encourages bad things to happen. Be positive. |01-07-2014|pisces
37|Honest effort always gets results, so keep plugging away at what you are working on and don’t get dispirited if results are slow in coming. Nothing you do is ever wasted and one day soon you will make that breakthrough you long for.|01-08-2014|pisces
38|You will be inspired to give of your best over the next 24 hours, no matter what it might be you are working on. Hold on to that positive, can-do attitude as long as you can, ideally until the moon is full seven days from now.|01-09-2014|pisces
39|Even a Taurus needs to take a break now and again and the planets indicate this is the perfect time to sit quietly and ponder the meaning of your existence. If that sounds a bit too intellectual, just plan your next big vacation.|01-10-2014|pisces
40||01-11-2014|pisces
41|If you change your mind about something over the next few days you will only change it back again towards the end of the month when you realize you have got facts and figures completely wrong. Stick with what you already know.|01-12-2014|pisces
42|Don’t listen to those who counsel caution. The only reason they don’t want you to do anything adventurous is because they are worried it will make them look bad. And they’re right, it will – which is all the more reason to do it.|01-13-2014|pisces
43|Over the next few days it will feel like you have turned a corner, that better days are coming. They probably won’t arrive for a few weeks yet but because you know they are on their way you can start making plans. Make them big.|01-14-2014|pisces
44|You would like nothing better than to turn your back on the past and start again but you know it isn’t practical. The planets urge you to make the most of the situation you find yourself in: it’s not as bad as you seem to believe.|01-15-2014|pisces
45|Any plans you make now are under the influence of the full moon, so try not to take them too seriously. A lot depends on whether you made them rationally or emotionally. If it was the latter, they may have to be changed.|01-16-2014|pisces
46|Something will happen today that to begin with annoys you, but when you calm down and think about it you will realize that it makes no difference to your plans. Carry on with what you were going to do – and do it brilliantly.|01-17-2014|pisces
47|Over the next few days you will become increasingly focused on your position in the wider world. Most likely you will feel you could be making more of your talents and you’re right, you could. It’s time to move up a gear.|01-18-2014|pisces
48|There will be several opportunities to boost your reputation and move up in the world over the coming week. But don’t think you have to fight every inch of the way. Turn on the charm – you’ll be amazed how far it takes you.|01-19-2014|pisces
49|Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart will do your reputation a power of good over the next few days, so put your doubts behind you and show the world you have what it takes. Work hard but don’t forget to play hard too.|01-20-2014|pisces
50|This is the perfect time to enhance your status and give your reputation a boost. You will find favor with people in positions of power but the most important thing is that you believe in yourself – then others will believe in you too.|01-21-2014|pisces
51|If there is something you have been trying to do but every time you get started something forces you to stop, it could be a sign you should be doing something else. Maybe the planets are trying to push you in a more rewarding direction.|01-22-2014|pisces
52|You will fall out with someone who does not share your aims and opinions. It’s just as well. The longer you go on pretending that you can work together despite your differences the less likely it is you will get any serious work done.|01-23-2014|pisces
53|Why are you so excitable? Whatever the reason you will be on the go from dawn to dusk today. You may need to rest and get your energy back tomorrow but for now you are a ball of energy that cannot be contained. Do something extraordinary.|01-24-2014|pisces
54|You may be wondering if you have taken on too much or taken too much for granted. Ignore any fears you may have because this is only a temporary loss of self-belief and soon you will be taking on even bigger challenges.|01-25-2014|pisces
55|You will find it much easier than usual to come up with big ideas this week, which is sure to impress employers and other important people. And that’s good because there is a new moon this week and that means new opportunities.|01-26-2014|pisces
56|You have been worrying about something for no good reason and what happens over the next few days will convince you that you have in fact been rather lucky. That luck will continue as someone makes you an offer you won’t want to refuse.|01-27-2014|pisces
57|You have your sights fixed on certain goals and won’t give up until you have reached them. However, cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs dreams and desires warns you need to get your ego out of the way. Let others guide you.|01-28-2014|pisces
58|You may be determined to discover the truth about something you believe others have been covering up, but don’t start reading fanciful stuff into situations that are really quite normal. You may have suspicions, but keep them to yourself.|01-29-2014|pisces
59|If you need to ask a favor of someone in a position of authority now is the time. Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart makes it easy for you to approach employers and other important people. Flatter them shamelessly.|01-30-2014|pisces
60|Something will seize your imagination today and before you know it you will be moving in a new direction. Does what you are doing have any practical or financial value? Who cares! It’s about enjoyment, not what you own or earn.|01-31-2014|pisces
61|The questions you are asking yourself now may be the same questions you were asking yourself yesterday and the day before that but you will get completely different answers. How do you know what is true and what is false? Trust your instincts.|02-01-2014|pisces
62|If you were planning something spectacular for the next few days it might pay you to think again, especially if there is money involved. The planets indicate there is no need to rush things – you are making good progress already.|02-03-2014|pisces
63|You may find it hard to believe what you hear today but don’t reject it out of hand because it may be true. Reserve judgment until later in the week when there are more facts available – though, of course, “facts” can be flexible too.|02-04-2014|pisces
64|Two weeks from now, when the Sun moves into one of the more positive areas of your chart, you will get the chance to do your own thing. Until then, though, you have to accept that others are still calling the shots. Stay calm. |02-05-2014|pisces
65|Do you go out and have fun or do you stay in and get some work done? If you are smart – and you are, you are – you will sacrifice short-term enjoyment for long-term peace of mind. In other words: get that work finished.|02-06-2014|pisces
66|Do you carry on with a difficult task or do you end it and focus on something a bit easier? Only you can decide but it does seem a bit of a waste to give up on it so soon. What happened to that Taurus staying power?|02-07-2014|pisces
67|Someone will tell you something you find hard to take seriously this weekend, but don’t dismiss it out of hand. If you dig a bit deeper you may find there is a nugget of truth in what they are saying, so try not to be too skeptical.|02-08-2014|pisces
68|Don’t be afraid to admit that you are out of your depth. The moment you speak up you will have friends and family members rushing to assist you, so why suffer in silence? You’ve helped others so often in the past – now let them help you.|02-10-2014|pisces
69|Whatever your ambitions may be right now, they will change dramatically over the next few weeks. Whatever happens you must believe that you are more than just a cog in the machine. You have the poise and the power to make a difference. |02-11-2014|pisces
70|You don’t find it easy to let others make decisions for you but today and tomorrow you are advised to put yourself in other people’s hands and let them call the shots. The planets indicate you won’t lose a thing. You may even win.|02-12-2014|pisces
71|If you say one thing but do another you leave yourself open to charges of hypocrisy. You don’t need to cut corners or bend the truth: you have so much going for you that you will still come out ahead of the game however you play it.|02-13-2014|pisces
72|You like to aim high and get on in the world but sometimes you wonder if it’s worth the effort. Only you can decide but now is not a good time to make decisions concerning either your career or your family. Think about it another day.|02-14-2014|pisces
73|There is a solution to every problem and although the problem that confronts you this weekend may seem daunting if you stay calm and stick to the facts you will find a way to overcome it. The trick is to use your head, not lose it.|02-15-2014|pisces
74|People in authority seem to favor you and because of that you can get away with most things but as from tomorrow they will expect you to become more of a team player. Can you do that? Of course you can – it’s in your interests.|02-17-2014|pisces
75|As the Sun moves into in the area of your chart that governs your hopes and wishes, your dreams and aspirations, you cannot help but raise your sights and aim for something better in life. Be ready to make serious changes – and sacrifices.|02-18-2014|pisces
76|You would be wise to keep your cash in your pocket today, because if you make one wrong move you may have to make several more to cover it up, and before you know what’s happening it will be costing you a fortune. Play safe. |02-19-2014|pisces
77|Aim to make new friends over the next 24 hours, especially with people whose interests are in some way out of the ordinary. It’s not true that Taurus is old-fashioned or has conservative tastes – in fact you can be a bit of a rebel.|02-20-2014|pisces
78|Patience and a sense of humor are a must today. Something is about to happen that not only takes you by surprise but makes your plans redundant, much to your annoyance. Something else you may need: a sense of perspective.|02-21-2014|pisces
79|There seem to be lots of hard luck stories about at the moment and you know that not a single one of them is true. You may be kind and generous by nature but anyone who asks for help this weekend may be out of luck.|02-22-2014|pisces
80|A particular group of people may seem completely different to you but you have more in common with them than you realize. What happens this week will awaken you to the fact that you should be working, and laughing, together more often.|02-23-2014|pisces
81|The line between fantasy and reality sometimes gets a bit blurred and there is a danger you could accidentally cross that line and do something foolish today. If you do make a mistake make sure you learn the lesson it has for you.|02-24-2014|pisces
82|You need to find ways to further your ambitions while not appearing too pushy or too selfish. This may be a time of great uncertainty but it is also a time of great opportunity. Stay calm, stay focused and, above all, stay the course.|02-25-2014|pisces
83|You seem to be hesitating and putting off something you know you will enjoy. Why is that? Whatever the reason you need to get started on it some time soon. Don’t worry that there may be an element of risk involved – that’s part of the fun.|02-26-2014|pisces
84|According to the planets you could make some serious money, but first you need to get serious about your ambitions. Most of all you need to commit yourself to an objective that may take years to reach. Give it some thought.|02-27-2014|pisces
85|Keep telling yourself that you have what it takes. Keep telling yourself that you will succeed. If you say it enough you will start to believe it and when that happens all sorts of doors will suddenly open to you. It’s all about your mind.|02-28-2014|pisces
86|Focus your mind on what it is you want to accomplish in life, because with a new moon and the power of Jupiter to help you there is every chance your dream will soon be a reality – even more so if you team up with like-minded people.|03-01-2014|pisces
87|You can influence people on the work front with ease this week, simply by being yourself. As Venus, your ruler, moves into the career area of your chart you will find it ridiculously easy to charm your way to success. So do it.|03-02-2014|pisces
88|If you take a risk over the next 24 hours it will more than likely pay off, maybe in a big way. Remember: no matter how powerful or how strong your rivals may be you have what they do not – staying power and a total lack of fear.|03-03-2014|pisces
89|You may be tempted to give up on something that just won’t go the way you want it to go. Don’t. Later this week something will happen that makes you realize that your slow progress is just a temporary blip – a necessary one too.|03-04-2014|pisces
90|Now is the time to prove yourself. Now is the time to show the world what you are capable of. With your ruler Venus moving into the career area of your chart today you will impress people of power with ease – IF you make the effort.|03-05-2014|pisces
91|You know what you want and you know how and where to get it, so all you have to do now is reach out your hand and take it. Sounds easy doesn’t it? Well that’s because it is. There can be no more excuses – make things happen!|03-06-2014|pisces
92|You may be willing to change your plans to help someone out today but don’t let them, or anyone else, tell you that you are obliged to do so. Let them know this is a one-off situation. After today they must look out for themselves.|03-07-2014|pisces
93|What happens over the next 48 hours, no matter how unexpected or how unsettling, will work in your favor in the long-term, so don’t fight it. And don’t get upset with a friend just because they disagree with you about something. It’s allowed!|03-08-2014|pisces
94|You need to shut yourself off from the world and be alone with your thoughts for a while. Others may wonder why you are suddenly so anti-social but they will give you the time and the space that you need. They owe you.|03-09-2014|pisces
95|Speak your mind today. Let the world know what you think. If certain people don’t like it that’s just too bad – in fact it’s a good sign. Jupiter in the communications area of your chart indicates that your words will have the desired effect.|03-10-2014|pisces
96|Make sure you base partnerships, both personal and professional, on mutual respect, because if you try to take liberties with friends, loved ones or work colleagues today you could pay dearly for it around the time of the full moon on the 16th.|03-11-2014|pisces
97|What comes to light in an unexpected manner today will most likely improve your bargaining position. It will also remind you that you don’t have to do it all on your own, that you have friends you can count on in a crisis.|03-12-2014|pisces
98|It’s okay if you want to shut yourself off from the world and be alone with your thoughts for a while – it’s allowed. Others may think you are behaving strangely but only because they are insensitive. They don’t possess your imagination.|03-13-2014|pisces
99|Use your imagination today. This is a great time for trying new things and adopting new methods, especially on the work front where, if you show you are able to adapt quickly to changing circumstances, you could be up for a promotion.|03-14-2014|pisces
100|This could be a tense weekend as family and work colleagues seem less than friendly for no obvious reason. Don’t worry about it. Most likely it has nothing to do with you. Most likely it’s just the full moon getting them down. It will pass.|03-15-2014|pisces
101|You may be a bit impulsive over the next few days but that is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact it could be a good thing if it means your efforts get noticed by people in positions of authority. Show them what you are capable of.|03-16-2014|pisces
102|Your mind may be bubbling with great ideas but what are they worth if you don’t do anything with them? If you want to get serious, if you want to make a difference in the world, it will take more than just ideas – it will take commitment.|03-17-2014|pisces
103|Someone in a position of authority will ask you to do something extra for them today and if you are smart you will agree. You may not be in the mood to work harder but later you will look back and realize how much it benefited you.|03-18-2014|pisces
104|It will benefit you to keep your plans to yourself today. Whatever information you may have that others do not you should treat it like gold dust. The less others know about what you are up to the more you will benefit.|03-19-2014|pisces
105|Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart means you may tend to fear the worst over the next few days, but that is quite natural. How good or how bad you feel is really down to you alone. Promise yourself you’ll smile more.|03-20-2014|pisces
106|You may have to remind a certain individual that you do not exist merely to be there when they call. Today’s lunar eclipse of Saturn in your opposite sign will help you express negative feelings in a positive way – positive for you, at least.|03-21-2014|pisces
107|What happens over the next few days might just transform the way you look at the world. The simple fact is you have been taking too much for granted and have been too trusting of those in positions of power. Start asking questions.|03-22-2014|pisces
108|If a friend or relative needs lifting mentally don’t wait to be asked – jump right in and do what you can to cheer them up. Your optimistic attitude will bring a smile to their face and it won’t be long before they believe in themselves again. |03-23-2014|pisces
109|The omens are good for you now, so why do you still seem to think that something bad is about to happen? What you need to realize is that if you think like that you increase the chances that it will happen that way. Be positive.|03-24-2014|pisces
110|You certainly have plenty of energy at your disposal but are you using it wisely? The planets will enable you to push harder and get more things done today but give some thought to your health as well. Don’t go to extremes.|03-25-2014|pisces
111|Social activities will go well today, so make an effort to get out and about and meet new people. The more things you do with others the more you will enjoy yourself and the more of an effect your actions will have on the world.|03-26-2014|pisces
112|Do you get involved in a feud between friends or do you keep your distance? You know the answer already, so don’t be silly and stand between them and try to keep the peace. If you do, quite probably they will gang up on you.|03-27-2014|pisces
113|The planets will give you the confidence to step into the spotlight and let important people know what you are capable of. Don’t worry that they might think you are being too pushy because that’s just what they are looking for.|03-28-2014|pisces
114|What you think is a problem is not really a problem at all and what happens next will help you recognize that fact. What is also a fact is that, despite what the doomsayers might say, the sky is not about to fall, at least not on you.|03-29-2014|pisces
115|You may want to believe that everyone is as honest as you but, of course, it isn’t true. The planets warn you will need to be on your guard, especially when the Sun squares up to Jupiter on Tuesday. Don’t trust everything you hear. |03-30-2014|pisces
116|You may be more robust than many but some people are ridiculously sensitive and you would be wise to keep that fact in mind today. If you want to get things done you should make it a policy to say nice things only, for now.|03-31-2014|pisces
117|There is no point getting worked up over something you can’t do much about. Having said that, while you may not be able to change things on a social or political level you can change things on a personal level. Just be a better person.|04-01-2014|pisces
118|What others tell you may seem reasonable but if something does not ring true you would be wise to be cautious. Most likely you are wrong to be so suspicions but today’s cosmic set-up warns it’s not a good idea to take chances.|04-02-2014|pisces
119|The planets will make it easy for you to complete a task that needs to be got out of the way as soon as possible. If you focus all your energy in a single direction today there is no telling what you might accomplish.|04-03-2014|pisces
120|You may be tempted to hit back at someone who has been spreading gossip about you but is it worth it? If you say something rude in return they will see they have managed to get under your skin. Just ignore them – that will hurt more.|04-04-2014|pisces
121|Yours may not be the most flexible sign of the zodiac but like it or not you will have to bend with the breeze over the next 48 hours. Don’t try to resist forces that are too strong for you or they will blow you clean away.|04-05-2014|pisces
122|No matter what you are offered over the next seven days you must not do anything that goes against your principles. You won’t be happy with yourself if you discover later on that others have suffered as a result of your actions.|04-06-2014|pisces
123|Sometimes you can be a bit offhand in your attitude and the planets warn you need to be more respectful if you want to get ahead. In everything you say and do try to work out how other people are likely to take it.|04-07-2014|pisces
124|It may seem as if your time and energy has been wasted but that’s not true. In fact, by the end of the week you will realize that you have gained in unexpected ways. In the long-term no effort is truly wasted. You should know that by now.|04-08-2014|pisces
125|Make sure you keep track of where your money is coming from and, just as importantly, where it is going to, over the next few days. Most people are trustworthy, of course, but someone may conveniently “forget” what they owe you.|04-09-2014|pisces
126|This may not be an easy time of year for you but you can sense that the day will soon be here when your luck turns for the better. Maybe that day will come sooner if you act as if nothing could possibly go wrong.|04-10-2014|pisces
127|Why are you trying to swim against the tide when you know it’s a battle you are destined to lose? You may not agree with the way things are going but common sense says you have no choice but to go with it, for now.|04-11-2014|pisces
128|Don’t let your responsibilities weigh you down. You may have no option but to work hard and help other people but you don’t have to push yourself beyond your natural limits. Physically, emotionally and mentally you must be kind to yourself.|04-12-2014|pisces
129|What you choose to do over the next seven days will to a large extent determine what the next six months or so are going to be like. The most important thing now is that you tie up loose ends, both in your personal life and in your career.|04-13-2014|pisces
130|You may have your suspicions about someone but the planets warn this is probably not the right time to go public with them. Even if your suspicions are correct you should keep your thoughts to yourself, at least for the time being.|04-14-2014|pisces
131|Are you working more for other people than you are for yourself? If so then it’s time to get a grip on the situation. Let those who are taking advantage of your generous nature know that this is as far as it goes – and mean it.|04-15-2014|pisces
132|Refuse to get uptight about the little things that sometimes go wrong. Both at home and at work it will seem as if people are deliberately letting you down but the truth is everyone is a bit confused at the moment, so make allowances.|04-16-2014|pisces
133|You may like to give the impression that you are immune to criticism but it’s not true and what someone says today will hurt you deeply. Could it be it hurts so much because, deep down, you know there might be some truth in it?|04-17-2014|pisces
134|You won’t have to try hard to make an impression today – with your ruler Venus making positive links to major planets everyone will think you are someone special. If you’re not already flavor of the month, you very soon will be.|04-18-2014|pisces
135|No matter how difficult life may have been of late the Sun’s move into your birth sign tomorrow will cheer you up no end. Give some serious thought to what you want to be doing over the coming year because it could be one of the best ever.|04-19-2014|pisces
136|Now that the Sun is moving into your sign you should go with the flow and believe that the tide of events will wash you up on a shore that is to your liking. The message of the stars this week is to trust that the universe is infinitely kind.|04-20-2014|pisces
137|You will encounter more than one individual today who, to put it bluntly, you really can’t stand the sight of. The best way of dealing with such people is to pretend they don’t exist. Just make out they’re invisible and walk on by.|04-21-2014|pisces
138|Why is it always you who is expected to make the important decisions? Maybe because others know they can trust you. There will be a lot of upheavals over the coming 12 months but you will be a rock in the storm – and others will cling to you.|04-22-2014|pisces
139|Mercury joins the Sun in your sign today and suddenly your mood will be a whole lot better. The next three weeks or so are potentially the best of the year for you, so take full advantage of the opportunities that come your way.|04-23-2014|pisces
140|Your attitude to material things will change a lot over the coming year. People will count more with you than money and when you focus on family and friends you will find there are ways to be rich that trump everything else. It’s the true meaning of wealth.|04-24-2014|pisces
141|All things may be possible for you now but the planets warn you should be tying up loose ends rather than starting anything new. Are you prepared for what is to come? Get your act together, and keep your friends close.|04-25-2014|pisces
142|Not only will you succeed over the coming 12 months but you will succeed with style. The one thing that should – and does – matter to you more than anything is that, whatever job you agree to do, you do it better than anyone else. Be the best – always.|04-26-2014|pisces
143|The solar eclipse in your sign on Tuesday means this is a week full of potential. Whatever it is you have been planning now is the time to get serious about it. You will find reserves of energy and enthusiasm you never knew you had.|04-27-2014|pisces
144|Mars, planet of energy, will encourage you to be more assertive over the coming year, which is good, but you also need to plan carefully. If you just throw yourself at life with no rhyme or reason you won’t accomplish a fraction of what you are capable of.|04-28-2014|pisces
145|You feel like you can take on the world and win – and most likely you can. Today’s eclipse in your sign endows you with the confidence to try things that at others times might scare you. Remember to focus your energy in one direction at a time.|04-29-2014|pisces
146|Your way with words will open any door for you over the coming year. You know just what to say, and who to say it to, to get what you need. Move around as much as you can – the more you expand your horizons the more success you’ll enjoy.|04-30-2014|pisces
147|Make sure you know what is expected of you before backing a plan or project that will inevitably take up a lot of your time and energy. And make sure there’s a timetable too – you need to know when you will be free again.|05-01-2014|pisces
148|You may be tempted to slow down and take a break and you have certainly earned that right but the planets urge you to keep going a bit longer. Make the most of your energy surge while you can – you know how quickly things can change.|05-02-2014|pisces
149|You may be poised to start something new and exciting but if you are smart you will give it another day or two before making your move. Sunday’s Sun-Pluto link will most likely bring huge changes – the sort you can take advantage of.|05-03-2014|pisces
150|Try not to get too caught up in society and its problems this week or you may miss out on something of great value. Not all the answers you need are to be found out there in the world at large some come directly from the heart.|05-04-2014|pisces
151|Someone in a position of authority will look favorably on you over the next few days and if you are smart you will get something more out of it than just praise. Ask for a raise or a promotion – or both. Chances are they’ll say “yes”.|05-05-2014|pisces
152|The Sun’s link to Jupiter will give your confidence a much-needed boost today but you may still have to learn that in order to get some you also have to give some – you cannot realistically expect it to be all one way.|05-06-2014|pisces
153|You must be positive today. Both in your personal life and at work there is a lot at stake and you need to know what you want – and have the courage to reach out and take it. If you can do all that you will prosper, big time.|05-07-2014|pisces
154|You may be a bit hesitant and suspicious today but that’s okay. The thing to remember is that the cosmos is very much on your side at the moment, so you can afford to take a risk – or not, as you see fit.|05-08-2014|pisces
155|You may believe that if you don’t act soon your big chance will pass you by but it simply isn’t true. The sense of urgency you feel is an illusion and what happens over the next two or three days will prove it. There’s really no rush.|05-09-2014|pisces
156|You will be a force to be reckoned with over the next 48 hours. The Sun in your sign encourages you to come out of your shell and let the world see what a can-do Bull you can be. There is so much for you to accomplish.|05-10-2014|pisces
157|Venus, your ruler, and Mars, planet of energy, combine on your birthday, which is good, but at times they will pull you indifferent directions. There will be two main strands to your affairs this year and some how you have to find room for them both.|05-11-2014|pisces
158|Be true and honest and resist the temptation to cut corners merely because no one can stop you. This is a great time for friendships and group activities and it will be even better if you are all working together on the same ethical level.|05-12-2014|pisces
159|Focus only on those activities that make you happy over the next 12 months. Others will say you should be doing this and doing that but it is entirely up to you how you order your life. If you follow your dreams all your other needs will be taken care of.|05-13-2014|pisces
160|A full moon on your birthday is a reminder that your short-term goals and long-term goals must complement one another. Every step you take, no matter how small, should move you in the direction of your ultimate target. Don’t waste a day of your journey.|05-14-2014|pisces
161|There may be a clash of wills today but at least it will clear the air – and remind certain people that just because you’re a nice guy does not mean you are a pushover. This is still your time of year and so much is still possible.|05-15-2014|pisces
162|If you need to make changes, in either your personal life or your career, then make them without a second thought or a backward glance. Some people may think you are being needlessly ruthless but if you don’t change now it may never happen. Go for it!|05-16-2014|pisces
163|Your mind creates your reality. What you think about now is what you will find yourself doing later. Meditate on that idea and let it influence what you think, say and do over the coming 12 months. You want happiness and success? Then create them.|05-17-2014|pisces
164|Just because the Sun leaves your birth sign this week does not mean that your luck is about to turn for the worse. Plenty of good things will still come your way, only now you have to be a bit more sensible about how you use them.|05-18-2014|pisces
165|If everyone seems to be saying what you want to hear it is probably because that is their intention. Mercury is the planet of communication but also deception and its position today suggests you can’t really trust what you hear.|05-19-2014|pisces
166|You will have to deal with some pretty ruthless people over the coming 12 months and that means you will have to be ruthless yourself. Decide where you are going to draw the line and tell them what will happen if they step over it. And mean it!|05-20-2014|pisces
167|Make a name for yourself. Do something out of the ordinary. Start each day with a specific goal in mind and go all out to reach it. Also, remember that, both in your work and in your private life, excellence is what you do in the next five minutes.|05-21-2014|pisces
168|Your insight is such that others may wonder if you are psychic. Maybe you are, in a way, but there is nothing supernatural about your aims: you want to be a success and you want to be rich. Act on what your inner voice tells you.|05-22-2014|pisces
169|You need to come down to earth a bit and deal with matters of a practical nature. Above all you must be sensible with money, especially if you are the kind of Taurus who takes an “easy come, easy go” attitude to cash.|05-23-2014|pisces
170|You don’t know whether to push yourself harder or take things easy. If you feel the need to prove yourself by all means take on new responsibilities but make sure you get plenty of rest too. Don’t hammer yourself into the ground.|05-24-2014|pisces
171|There is no point worrying about a money matter because it is out of your hands. The approaching new moon suggests that it’s highly unlikely anything bad will happen, at least not to you. You might even come out ahead of the game.|05-25-2014|pisces
172|The moment you start seeing yourself as a victim is the moment when you lose. No matter what other people may be saying and doing you and you alone are master of your fate, so be positive and think like a winner again.|05-26-2014|pisces
173|You need to be a bit more serious about your cash flow situation. Tomorrow’s new moon will make it clear where and how savings need to be made – after that it’s up to you. No more shopping sprees for you – for now.|05-27-2014|pisces
174|You must hold out for what it is you know you deserve. The planets indicate it will be your rivals who blink first, so look tough, act tough and be tough in your approach to all kinds of negotiations, especially those involving money.|05-28-2014|pisces
175|You need to open up a bit and show your vulnerable side. Too often you give the impression that nothing can bring you down when, in reality, you are as sensitive as everyone else. Find a comfortable shoulder to cry on today.|05-29-2014|pisces
176|You are strongly advised not to make too many plans – you have enough on your plate as it is. If someone asks you to take on extra responsibilities you must turn them down flat. Your health could be at risk if you push yourself too hard.|05-30-2014|pisces
177|You are trying too hard to impress other people. Don’t worry what friends or work colleagues may think about you, just focus your time and energy on what you should be doing and the results will speak volumes about your ability.|05-31-2014|pisces
178|You will be rather assertive over the next few days, which is good. However, if you find yourself in a situation where you are able to make others do what they clearly don’t want to do you must back off. Their feelings are important too.|06-01-2014|pisces
179|Be careful when dealing with people today, especially if money is in some way involved. Anything that sounds too good to be true most likely is, so don’t let your enthusiasm – or your greed – get the better of you.|06-02-2014|pisces
180|Watch what you spend over the next 24 hours because if you go over the top you are sure to regret it. The planets warn you may not be as well off as you seem to believe. Watch out for those hidden costs.|06-03-2014|pisces
181|Sometimes the standards you set are impossible to reach and that seems to be the case at the moment. Current influences make you intensely ambitious but don’t forget you have limits like everyone else. Make sure you know what they are.|06-04-2014|pisces
182|Why are you trying to do everything the hard way? Is it because you think you have to prove yourself? Not only is it unnecessary but it could also be self-defeating. Be who you are, not who you think others want you to be.|06-05-2014|pisces
183|You will get the chance to move up in the world today but you need to act quickly. Uranus, planet of the unexpected, will bring sudden upheavals but even though they may seem a bit frightening they will work in your favor.|06-06-2014|pisces
184|Your routine will be disrupted in some way today and although you won’t like it you will have to adapt. Don’t bother complaining to people in positions of power because they don’t really care. Keep a low profile – it’s by far your best option.|06-07-2014|pisces
185|Because Taurus is one of the zodiac’s “fixed” signs you don’t like to admit, even to yourself, that you might ever be wrong. That could be a problem this week as the planets demand you be more flexible. Can you even spell the word?|06-08-2014|pisces
186|The more you try to convince people that you know what you are doing the more they disbelieve you – a most frustrating situation! Never mind. You don’t need their support to do what you know must be done. You’re tough enough to go it alone.|06-09-2014|pisces
187|The planets warn you will have to fight hard to get your way today. Alternatively, of course, you could decide the effort isn’t worth it and not fight at all. Let fate take its course. You don’t have to be in control all the time.|06-10-2014|pisces
188|You seem to have retreated into your shell a bit of late and in doing so have lost contact with a number of important people. Make it a priority today to look them up and let them know you still exist – and you still care.|06-11-2014|pisces
189|The planets warn you may do something so out of character today or tomorrow that even those who know you well will be shocked. Hopefully it won’t damage your reputation too much but it will certainly lead to some interesting gossip!|06-12-2014|pisces
190|You will be in an impulsive mood today and there is a danger you might fall out with someone you really should be on good terms with. There is no point starting a war of words just because you don’t care for the way they do business.|06-13-2014|pisces
191|A lot of your time of late seems to have been spent on issues that are not worth the effort and people you will never really get along with. As from today you must be more selective. What is of prime importance to you? Do only that.|06-14-2014|pisces
192|Try not to show that you are sensitive about what other people are saying about you. If they can see you are hurt it will encourage them to be even more negative. Give the impression that you could not care less about their opinions.|06-15-2014|pisces
193|Money matters of one sort or another will take up a lot of time today. It may all seem rather trivial to you but you must take it seriously. The more financial loose ends you can tie up now the more fun you can have later on.|06-16-2014|pisces
194|Why are some people so negative? It seems that the more ideas and suggestions you come up with the more reasons they find to reject them. Maybe you should take the hint and stop trying to win them round. Go it alone for a while.|06-17-2014|pisces
195|Even if you are the kind of Taurus who keeps your emotions under control you will be much more outgoing than usual today. There are so many good things going on in your life that you’ve got to stand up and tell the whole world.|06-18-2014|pisces
196|There is no point cursing fate if what happens today is not to your liking. In the long-term everything will come good, so be strong and never doubt that no matter what happens, be it “good” or be it “bad”, you will be stronger for it.|06-19-2014|pisces
197|You may be tempted to interfere in someone else’s personal situation but no good will come of it. The simple fact is you cannot do everything for everyone, so decide who is on your help list and let others learn from their own mistakes.|06-20-2014|pisces
198|There were times of late when you came close to cracking but you kept at it and managed to turn a bad situation in your favor. Now you are in a position to turn the tables and put the pressure on your rivals. Do it with a smile.|06-21-2014|pisces
199|Your way with words will aid you over the next few days but it could also work against you if you use it to deceive people into believing things you know to be untrue. It might help you in the short-term but over time you’ll lose out.|06-22-2014|pisces
200|Friends and relatives will do what you ask of them if you ask nicely. Also, if there is something you know they desire and you are in a position to get it for them then go for it. Bribery is not always a bad thing!|06-23-2014|pisces
201|If you are tired of playing second fiddle to someone of lesser talent then now is the time to do something about it. Let employers and other important people know what you can do. Part of the problem is you rarely push yourself forward.|06-24-2014|pisces
202|It annoys you when others drag their feet but there is no point losing your temper if a friend or loved one takes too much time over something today. Think of it as part of life’s rich tapestry – and do whatever it takes to hold in that scream.|06-25-2014|pisces
203|The world is a wonderful place and what happens over the next 48 hours will remind you just how much is possible if you have a positive outlook on life. Your can-do attitude will encourage others to be positive too.|06-26-2014|pisces
204|Short trips will be productive today, so don’t stay in one place for too long. The more you are on the move the more likely it is you will meet people who can be of some use to you socially or in your career.|06-27-2014|pisces
205|At some stage over the next 48 hours you will see or hear something that makes you look at the world in a radically different way. Your new way of thinking will answer many of the difficult questions you have been asking.|06-28-2014|pisces
206|You need to keep up the pressure on those who seek to deny you what it is you deserve. If you give them even the smallest of hints that you might give up they will go all out to deny you. Make a fuss – and hang in there.|06-29-2014|pisces
207|You need to get serious about your money situation. For too long now you have been content to take what you were given but as communications planet Mercury is about to move in your favor again you must ask for more. No, demand it!|06-30-2014|pisces
208|The more others protest about what you are doing the more you will do it. You’re stubborn like that. Just be careful that your abrasive attitude does not upset someone in a position of authority. Why make enemies of powerful people?|07-01-2014|pisces
209|Something good will come your way today – something you have earned entirely by your own efforts. Others may say you don’t deserve to be so fortunate but only because they now wish they had been as creative and as hard-working as you.|07-02-2014|pisces
210|There is no need to be quite so competitive. The planets indicate if you relax and let life come to you today the rewards will be greater than you imagined – and you won’t have wasted your time and your energy on senseless rivalries.|07-03-2014|pisces
211|You like to take the initiative and make things happen but today you will have to yield to the whims of those who do not share your sense of adventure. It may be frustrating but you can’t change it so don’t let it upset you.|07-04-2014|pisces
212|The more others insist that you conform to their standards the more you will insist on going your own way and doing your own thing. You will be even more stubborn than usual over the next 48 hours – and that’s very stubborn indeed!|07-05-2014|pisces
213|You may be annoyed that you lost out in some way but you have only yourself to blame. Others warned you not to go it alone but did you listen? Of course not. In future, try not to be so stubborn and recognize who is trying to help.|07-06-2014|pisces
214|Life may be a bit of a struggle at the moment but on the plus side you will learn something useful from it. You are here for a reason. Your life has meaning and purpose. So stop complaining and start living again.|07-07-2014|pisces
215|It is always important to get your timing right and the planets indicate that the right time for making your mark on the world is now. Don’t wait to be asked to show what you can do – elbow your way to the front and just do it.|07-08-2014|pisces
216|The grass often looks greener on the other side of the fence but the planets warn you should stay right where you are. If you are thinking of changing your job, or maybe even your entire career, you are advised to think again.|07-09-2014|pisces
217|You like things to be in their proper place but some people enjoy making a mess just to annoy you. You know who they are and you know better than to let them get under your skin. Stay out of their way today.|07-10-2014|pisces
218|If your frame of mind is negative now you will find it hard to be positive over the next few days. Try to avoid people whose attitude might bring you down. If they want to be miserable that’s fine but you don’t have to join them.|07-11-2014|pisces
219|News from a distant place may not be music to your ears but don’t overreact. Today’s full moon cuts across the communications angle of your chart, so if you say the wrong thing you may regret it. Keep your thoughts to yourself.|07-12-2014|pisces
220|By all means turn down a social invitation in order to spend more time with someone you are close to emotionally. According to the planets this person is feeling a bit neglected and it’s your responsibility to do something about it.|07-13-2014|pisces
221|Act quickly if someone in a position of power offers you something you desire. It’s okay to be cautious, at least to begin with, but if you leave it too long you could find the opportunity has been offered to someone else.|07-14-2014|pisces
222|The more others try to persuade you there is nothing to worry about the more you wonder what they are trying to hide. Maybe you are being suspicious for no reason but, on the other hand, the planets do suggest you need to be careful.|07-15-2014|pisces
223|You need to stand back from money matters and business issues and see your life from a wider perspective. There are many types of wealth and the most important of all is to be rich in knowledge – and love, of course.|07-16-2014|pisces
224|You are entitled to enjoy yourself and there is no reason at all why you should feel guilty just because some people have not been as lucky as you. Help others when you get the chance but make sure you get the best out of life too.|07-17-2014|pisces
225|Your task for the next 24 hours is to find a way to release all that pent-up energy that’s inside you in a way that does you good while not harming other people. Give it some thought, then do something physical.|07-18-2014|pisces
226|You seem to be reluctant to try something everybody else is raving about. Maybe you’re right, maybe your sixth sense is telling you to take care. Or maybe you are being too cautious. Ultimately, of course, only you can decide.|07-19-2014|pisces
227|If you want to earn other people’s respect you have to lead by example. That applies in all areas but especially on the home front where the planets indicate that loved ones are on the point of rebellion! Don’t be too assertive for your own good.|07-20-2014|pisces
228|This is an important time for career matters, especially if you are the kind of Taurus who wants to get on in the world. Being ambitious is not a sin and anyone who suggests that it might be is not to be trusted.|07-21-2014|pisces
229|It may seem as if the whole world is against you but nothing could be further from the truth. All that is happening is that the Sun’s move into one of the more sensitive areas of your chart makes youmore touchy than usual. Lighten up!|07-22-2014|pisces
230|If the stresses and strains of life are beginning to get to you just take an hour or two out of your busy schedule and sit somewhere quiet where you can refresh both your body and mind. You must always find time to relax.|07-23-2014|pisces
231|Someone close needs a confidence boost and you are the one who can give it to them. Say or do what you know will make them feel good about themselves – as a bonus it will help you feel good about yourself as well.|07-24-2014|pisces
232|Someone you like may say something hurtful about you today, but you must not let it get to you and you must not let your friendship suffer. There is no ill intent and you are probably being a bit too sensitive for your own good.|07-25-2014|pisces
233|Expect many changes over the next 48 hours, both those you are happy with and those you would avoid if you possibly could. Certain people may at times annoy you but don’t lose your temper – it’s simply not worth the effort.|07-26-2014|pisces
234|It won’t be long before you find your voice and let others know what it is you expect of them. It might be wise, however, not to say anything too outrageous, especially as Venus, your ruler, opposes power planet Pluto over the next few days.|07-27-2014|pisces
235|Today’s cosmic activity means you will need to spell everything out in plain and simple language. If you leave even the smallest of room for doubt then lines will get crossed and tempers will get frayed and that’s no good to anyone.|07-28-2014|pisces
236|If you want something enough you will find a way to get it. If you have the courage to take a risk when everyone around you is telling you to stick with what you know and trust you may hit the jackpot. Listen to your instincts – always.|07-29-2014|pisces
237|There is a danger that you will overreact to criticism and say or do something that comes back to haunt you. Both at home and at work you must think carefully before replying to what others say. Stay in control of your emotions.|07-30-2014|pisces
238|A colleague will let you down today and you won’t be too happy about it. But don’t let it bother you too much because you are capable of carrying on and making a success of a project on your own – and all the glory will be yours.|07-31-2014|pisces
239|If someone you don’t usually get along with makes an effort to be nice to you today you must make an effort to be nice to them in return. Just because you have different values does not mean you cannot get along, or even be friends.|08-01-2014|pisces
240|You may not be able to explain to others how you have reached a certain conclusion but deep down you know it is right. The planets indicate you won’t be in the least bit hesitant – you know what you want and you know how to get it.|08-02-2014|pisces
241|You want to do something useful with your life and Neptune, planet of generosity of spirit, will give you the opportunity this week. Don’t try to do it alone though: do it with people who share your ideals – and your big heart.|08-03-2014|pisces
242|Your logic circuits may seem a bit disconnected today and you will have to make an effort not to let little things annoy you. Strive to see the good in everyone you meet. It won’t always be easy but it’s there if you look for it.|08-04-2014|pisces
243|You have never been a slave to your desires, so why are you acting as if you have no choice in what you are expected to do? The fact is you always have a choice and to claim otherwise is simply not right. Take responsibility.|08-05-2014|pisces
244|Over the next few days you will have to strike a balance between the needs of your loved ones and the needs of employers and other important people. You CAN please them all but you need to be smart and plan carefully.|08-06-2014|pisces
245|You want to be active, and that’s good, but don’t expect others to be as motivated as you. Not everyone shares your passion for making things work and this may be one of those days when the only way to get things done is to do them yourself.|08-07-2014|pisces
246|Focus on other people’s needs today, because the planets will give you the chance to be of service to someone who does not share your strength of character. And, of course, what you do for others now will, one day, come back to you.|08-08-2014|pisces
247|It may seem as if the odds are stacked against you but the planets suggest you can easily break through any obstacles that have been placed in your path. Let everyone know you mean business. Few will dare take you on.|08-09-2014|pisces
248|Try not to jump to conclusions this week because most likely they will be wrong. Wait until the early part of next week before deciding if a friend really has let you down, because only then will you be able to see the situation clearly.|08-10-2014|pisces
249|You are not the kind who enjoys having your private life made public and at some stage today you will have to let someone know that their big mouth is not appreciated. They’ll get the message, if you say it with enough menace.|08-11-2014|pisces
250|By all means aim high, by all means set yourself targets, but don’t make them so far ahead of what you are capable of that failure is more likely than not. You don’t have to be perfect – you’re perfect just the way you are.|08-12-2014|pisces
251|If you find yourself torn between your loved ones and your busy work schedule today the best thing to do is to make a decision and stick to it. You can’t please everyone but if you don’t make a choice you won’t please anyone.|08-13-2014|pisces
252|Friends and loved ones have the upper hand at the moment and if you are smart you will accept that and not make a fuss. Also, it might not be wise to draw too much attention to yourself on the work front. Keep a low profile.|08-14-2014|pisces
253|The pace of life will pick up considerably today and over the weekend and if you are involved in anything of a creative nature it will go extremely well for you. Make sure the powers that be are aware of what you can do.|08-15-2014|pisces
254|There will be times this weekend when doubts creep in and you do not feel as self-assured as you look. Developments on the work front may be especially unsettling but there is no need to worry – it will work out for the best in the end.|08-16-2014|pisces
255|If you fell out with a friend or work colleague recently you should be thinking of ways you can make up with them. That may not be possible until later in the week but you can set the scene now – by not being so touchy!|08-17-2014|pisces
256|By all means splash out and buy yourself something that makes you feel good. Okay, so maybe you will regret it later when your credit card bill is due but you need something to cheer you up right now. Go for it.|08-18-2014|pisces
257|You are being pulled between two extremes, making it difficult for you to make up your mind about the best course of action. Do you take a chance or do you play safe? Only you can decide, but you must make it quick.|08-19-2014|pisces
258|You need to give others the impression that you are not the sort who can be easily manipulated. Act tough today, even if you don’t feel tough inside, because the first impression you give others is the impression that will last.|08-20-2014|pisces
259|Over the past few weeks cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart has made it hard to be positive, but that will change on Saturday when the Sun moves in your favor. Suddenly life will be worth living again. |08-21-2014|pisces
260|An unpleasant issue will have to be dealt with today. You can avoid it no longer. Of course, if you had sorted it out when the situation first arose several months ago you would not be in this position now. Never mind, get busy.|08-22-2014|pisces
261|The Sun’s change of signs this weekend marks the start of the most dynamic time of the year, for you at least. Forget about your troubles and think only of the fun times you are going to have. There will be too many of them to count.|08-23-2014|pisces
262|Cosmic activity in the most dynamic area of your chart will inspire you to think and act in adventurous new ways over the next few days. In fact it is no exaggeration to say it will in some way or other transform your existence.|08-24-2014|pisces
263|You were born with some remarkable talents but have you been making the most of them? If you are honest you will admit you could have done more but that’s okay because you will always get another chance and here comes one now!|08-26-2014|pisces
264|Don’t complain that certain people seem to be making life difficult for you because, even if it is true, it will be to your advantage. Sometimes in life it is necessary to take a small step back before you can take a huge leap forward.|08-27-2014|pisces
265|Be on your guard today, especially when dealing with money matters. There is a danger that someone will try to cheat you, and if your mind is elsewhere they may even succeed. Trust is not something you should give easily now.|08-28-2014|pisces
266|If you expect great things of yourself then you will accomplish great things. But make sure it is your own expectations you are trying to live up to – not other people’s. Friends and family will never know you as well as you know yourself.|08-29-2014|pisces
267|It may seem as if someone is being rude for no good reason, and maybe they are, but don’t let it get to you. Move your attention away from their negativity and highlight instead the positive plans you have made. Focus on your dream.|08-30-2014|pisces
268|Be alert to new possibilities. You may be happy with your life but there is always something you can do to make it even better and you will know without a shadow of a doubt what that something is this week. Don’t get stuck in a rut. |08-31-2014|pisces
269|You seem to be worrying about the few little things that are going wrong in your life and ignoring all the big things that are going right. Raise your sights and see the wider cosmic picture. Life is good and getting better by the minute.|09-01-2014|pisces
270|Money matters will go very well indeed today as will anything to do with your working routine. It seems that Lady Luck is very much on your side at the moment and if you are smart you will make good use of her.|09-02-2014|pisces
271|This is one of the best times of the year for getting things done, but the things you do must not be of a minor nature. Make use of today’s Sun-Pluto contact to aim higher than usual. Look to the sky, then shoot for the stars.|09-03-2014|pisces
272|If there is something you have always wanted to do but never quite got around to starting, don’t worry – you are about to get another chance. This is the ideal time to begin something of a creative nature, so get serious about it.|09-04-2014|pisces
273|The next few weeks will be special for you, and for those who are special to you. Even people you think of as rivals or enemies will be more amenable than usual. So if you need to ask favors now is the time to make your play.|09-05-2014|pisces
274|The harder you try to bring a little happiness into someone’s life the more determined they are to be sad. Take the hint and leave them alone. Some people enjoy wallowing in despair, so leave them to it until they’re ready to smile again.|09-06-2014|pisces
275|You should by now have a clear idea of what it is you are hoping to accomplish, and because there are no more doubts in your mind you will be able to take decisive action at last. Act for others too when you can.|09-07-2014|pisces
276|According to the planets you are unusually in tune with the spirit of the age – for the next 24 hours at least – so don’t be surprised if strangers approach you and treat you as if you are someone special. Because you are.|09-08-2014|pisces
277|If a dispute over a career or family matter seems to be dragging on, now is the time to settle your differences. The full moon means it’s not a case of one side winning and the other side losing – either you both win or you both lose.|09-09-2014|pisces
278|A new person on your social scene will get your attention and you may even be thinking in terms of romance, but the planets warn the relationship is unlikely to last. Keep it low key and light-hearted and you’ll both have a lot of fun.|09-10-2014|pisces
279|Whatever difficulties you face at this moment don’t try to blame other people for them. The more you deny that you are responsible the worse things are likely to get. Next time around, don’t forget that causes always have consequences.|09-11-2014|pisces
280|You must be true to your principles today. A rival may appear to have an advantage because they are prepared to use dishonest methods but over time their tactics will rebound on them, leaving you with a clear run to success.|09-12-2014|pisces
281|A serious attempt to cut back on your spending now will save you a great deal of trouble later on. Do you really need all those things you’ve been buying? Of course not. Get your financial house in order over the next 48 hours.|09-13-2014|pisces
282|It may feel like you are losing something that is precious to you but when you realize what the future has in store – as you will do any day now – your hankering after what you lost will soon be forgotten. The future is where it’s at.|09-14-2014|pisces
283|Something you say may seem obvious to you but other people may struggle to understand what you are talking about. Try to see things from their point of view, then explain what’s going on in plain and simple language.|09-15-2014|pisces
284|An opportunity to improve a partnership or relationship could easily be missed. Focus on it to the exclusion of everything else. Career issues and money matters may seem important but in the greater scheme of things they don’t count for much.|09-16-2014|pisces
285|The Sun in Virgo endows you not only with a positive outlook but also a willingness to take risks. Something you begin over the next few days could change your life in remarkable ways, so stop dithering and start living the dream.|09-17-2014|pisces
286|Avoid anything too adventurous today, especially if it is packaged in an appealing way. Stick with what feels right to you, even if others say it is boring. You know what you like and there is no logical reason why you should change it.|09-18-2014|pisces
287|It does not matter what threats you make today a work colleague will move at their own speed – and that’s dead slow! Don’t bother losing your temper as it will just encourage them to dig in their heels even more. Grit your teeth and bear it.|09-19-2014|pisces
288|You are enjoying life at the moment but you sense that you will soon have to turn your mind to more serious matters. Pay more attention to your health this weekend. It may be time for a new diet or fitness regime.|09-20-2014|pisces
289|You know what you want and you know how to get it but don’t push too hard. Your confidence may be high at the moment but confidence alone may not be enough. The planets warn it will pay you to take things slowly for a day or two.|09-21-2014|pisces
290|Be careful you don’t offend people by making a joke about things they take very seriously. Yes, of course, the world would be a better place if everyone could laugh at misfortune, especially their own, but it isn’t going to happen.|09-22-2014|pisces
291|A testing phase is about to begin but you can make things easier for yourself by being a little less intense in both your attitude and your actions. Your workload will increase but don’t be tempted to burn the candle at both ends.|09-23-2014|pisces
292|You may have a natural grasp of how something works but a friend or family member just isn’t getting it and it’s up to you to help them out. Don’t get impatient, just explain it to them in simple language – several times if needs be.|09-24-2014|pisces
293|No doubt there is a rational explanation for everything that ever happens but sometimes things happen that make you wonder if there is not more going on. Keep your mind open to new and strange possibilities over the next 24 hours.|09-25-2014|pisces
294|Something will happen over the next few days that undermines your confidence, and it takes a lot to make a Taurus start questioning themselves. Be that as it may everything will be resolved when Venus, your ruler, changes signs next week.|09-26-2014|pisces
295|A dispute that has dragged on far too long must be resolved this weekend. Make an effort to see the other person’s side of the story as well as your own. The fact is that neither of you is either wholly right or wholly wrong.|09-27-2014|pisces
296|The lesson of the stars for the coming week is that you must learn to be grateful for what you have got. Something you have always taken for granted is about to be challenged and it will make you realize just how lucky you are. |09-28-2014|pisces
297|If a friend or work colleague tries to turn each and every chat you have into a conversation about them you must let them know it’s getting a bit boring. It’s not about “them” or “me” – it’s about “us”. Or at least it should be.|09-29-2014|pisces
298|Make an effort to tackle routine matters today, Yes, of course, they are boring but if you don’t get them out of the way now they will continue to nag at you. You may also learn something you can turn to your financial advantage.|09-30-2014|pisces
299|You seem to be in one of your silly moods – and that’s a good thing. Most days you might worry what others think of your behavior but today you just cannot be bothered. If more conservative types are offended that’s too bad.|10-01-2014|pisces
300|Don’t wait for permission to do something you instinctively know is right. Even the most agreeable Taurus should be more assertive when there is a higher good at work. And remember: the best way to get something done is to do it yourself.|10-02-2014|pisces
301|There may be many things in your life that you could change for the better but is it worth it if, in doing so, you have to change habits and routines you feel comfortable with? Only you can decide, but you need to decide quickly.|10-03-2014|pisces
302|If you are satisfied with an agreement of some kind then it does not matter what other people think about it. Yes, maybe you could negotiate a better deal if you were a bit tougher, but if you’re happy the universe is happy too.|10-04-2014|pisces
303|Whether or not you have a hard time of things this week depends not on your circumstances but on your state of mind. A lunar eclipse in the most sensitive area of your chart urges you to look on the bright side – always.|10-05-2014|pisces
304|According to the planets you have reached the end of one particular road and what happens in the run-up to Wednesday’s eclipse will point you in a new direction. After that it’s up to you. What’s holding you back? Absolutely nothing.|10-06-2014|pisces
305|What happens in your working environment over the next few days will give you the chance to show how much you have learned and how well suited you are to take on a leadership position. While others lose their heads you will be the picture of calm.|10-07-2014|pisces
306|Treat yourself today – do something for no other reason than it makes you feel good. Some people may be shocked by your extravagant behavior but that will only add to your enjoyment. How far do you take it? As far as you like!|10-08-2014|pisces
307|A business or financial venture may seem straightforward but as Mercury is in one of its retrograde phases there may be hidden pitfalls. For that reason alone you are advised not to commit yourself unless you have a get-out clause – in writing.|10-09-2014|pisces
308|You must be decisive today, especially on the work front where the right word in the right ear at the right time could open doors that have been closed for too long. Don’t hesitate: the moment an opportunity arises you must seize it.|10-10-2014|pisces
309|If you pretend to be something or someone you are not over the next 48 hours you are sure to be found out, and the results could be embarrassing. The personality you were born with cannot be changed but it can be improved – so embrace it.|10-11-2014|pisces
310|If your desire is strong enough and if your motives are pure enough you will attract into your life precisely what you need this week. You are sending out powerful signals to the universe and the universe will be delighted to grant you your wish.|10-12-2014|pisces
311|The more you worry about something the worse it will get. But the opposite is also true: the more you look on the bright side and believe everything will come right the better it will get. Your reality reflects what goes on in your mind.|10-13-2014|pisces
312|A number of serious matters will have to be dealt with later in the week but today you can relax and enjoy the good things in life. Venus, your ruler, linked to Jupiter means you will find fun wherever you are and whatever you do.|10-14-2014|pisces
313|The planets are very much on your side at the moment but for best results you should not wait for things to happen, you should make things happen yourself. If you make twice as much effort today you will get four times as much back.|10-15-2014|pisces
314|At some stage today it will be painfully clear that you have been moving in the wrong direction, and that means you must change course immediately. Ignoring the evidence will only compound the error and make things even worse than before.|10-16-2014|pisces
315|It’s nice to know that your efforts are appreciated and Saturn in your opposite sign is about to bring you some kind of reward or recognition. It may not be anything out of the ordinary but it will give a huge boost to your confidence.|10-17-2014|pisces
316|Don’t be too harsh on yourself if you say something that rubs others up the wrong way. Yes, of course, it would have been nice if you had given it a bit more thought before opening your mouth but no one’s perfect, not even you! |10-19-2014|pisces
317|There may be many things that interest you but there is only one thing that demands your attention. A serious matter needs to be dealt with today and, if you deal with it quickly and efficiently, you can then move on to something more exciting.|10-20-2014|pisces
318|The approaching eclipse marks either a turning point or a point of no return. Which it is depends a great deal on your attitude. Treat what goes out of your life over the next few days as surplus to requirements – you really no longer need it.|10-21-2014|pisces
319|A little voice in the back of your head is telling you to get tough with someone who has taken one too many liberties in recent weeks. If you don’t they will take an even bigger liberty tomorrow or the day after, and the results could be ugly.|10-22-2014|pisces
320|As both the Sun and Venus, your ruler, move into the partnership area of your chart today it will pay you to be more open about your feelings. Not too much though – others don’t want to know everything – just that they mean something to you.|10-23-2014|pisces
321|It may seem like a partnership of some sort has reached a point where it can no longer do anything for you but you are wrong. What happens today will make you realize you have been taking it for granted – and it still has much to offer.|10-24-2014|pisces
322|What takes place this weekend may not be entirely to your liking but if you make a point of viewing new experiences as opportunities rather than as setbacks this can still be a positive phase. Expect the best and you will get the best.|10-25-2014|pisces
323|There is only so much you can do for someone you love – at some point you have to let them get on with it and learn from their own mistakes. If they take a fall then so be it – all you can do is be there to help them up again.|10-26-2014|pisces
324|Avoid complicated solutions. The problem you will be faced with over the next two or three days is really quite simple, which means the answer must be simple too. Focus on the basics and don’t read into it what isn’t there at all.|10-27-2014|pisces
325|Don’t get so absorbed in a work or social issue that you miss the signals a loved one is sending you. They need your attention and, what is more, they have a right to it. Mundane matters can wait – relationships cannot.|10-29-2014|pisces
326|If someone reacts in an emotional way to what you say today then perhaps you should take the hint and steer clear of touchy issues. They will have to face up to reality sooner or later, of course, but now is not the right time.|10-30-2014|pisces
327|You may be eager to know what is going on but the planets suggest it’s unlikely that family and friends will confide in you. Stay calm and don’t let them see how desperate you are — that will make them even more secretive.|11-02-2014|pisces
328|What happens today may not by itself seem of any great significance but with the benefit of hindsight you will see it plays a big part in the grand scheme of things. Never doubt you are on the road to somewhere good. |11-03-2014|pisces
329|A touch of realism is needed today, both on a creative level and in affairs of the heart. You don’t want to be unkind, of course, but you realize it is better to be blunt than misunderstood. Loved ones will one day thank you for your honesty.|11-04-2014|pisces
330|The more time and effort you pour into a certain situation the worse it appears to get. Why not take the hint and back off a bit? You will enjoy life more if you stop worrying about things over which you have no control. |11-05-2014|pisces
331|It would be a mistake to place your faith in what other people believe rather than what your instincts tell you is true. Have the courage of your convictions and do only what feels right to you. You don’t need anyone to hold your hand.|11-06-2014|pisces
332|You may be tempted to put pressure on a partner or loved one do something for you but according to the planets it isn’t necessary. Even if they do not agree with your aims they will, out of a sense of duty, help if they can. Just ask nicely.|11-07-2014|pisces
333|If a friend or relative wants to make a decision for you, let them. You should find it easier to trust other people’s judgment now that Mercury is moving into your opposite sign of Scorpio. Yes, they have your interests at heart.|11-08-2014|pisces
334|What starts out as good news first thing this week may look like bad news later in the week but try not to get worked up about it. Things change and all you can do is change with them. What changes later in the week will delight you.|11-09-2014|pisces
335|Be honest about what you think today, even if your point of view is likely to offend certain people. You are as entitled to your opinion as they are to theirs, so speak up and make sure you get your message across. It’s a message worth hearing.|11-10-2014|pisces
336|Be clear about what you believe and be positive when communicating those beliefs to other people. You will find that all sorts of people are interested in what you have to say, but listen as well, because learning is a two-way process. |11-11-2014|pisces
337|The pressure is beginning to mount and you feel there are things in your life which need to be changed, and you are right. The fact is if you cannot change them yourself, fate will change them for you. Maybe you should let it.|11-12-2014|pisces
338|Your powers of self-discipline will be tested over the next 24 hours – and you will pass the test with flying colors. However, a harder test is on its way, so don’t think you have done all you have to. Be vigilant.|11-13-2014|pisces
339|You need something to take your mind off your problems. Better still, you need to reorder your mind so you can see they are not really problems at all. Treat life as a game and make sure you have fun – then you’ll be a winner too.|11-14-2014|pisces
340|You will have to be strict with yourself this weekend if you are to finish all the tasks you have set yourself. Start immediately and don’t stop until everything is done. The longer you put it off, the harder it will be. |11-15-2014|pisces
341|There is nothing you cannot handle and nothing you cannot do if you believe in yourself. It may seem as if others have more talent and experience than you but it’s simply not true. Act as if you cannot fail, and you won’t.|11-16-2014|pisces
342|Loved ones, colleagues and people in positions of authority hold you in high regard because you are an individual – you refuse to be like everyone else. Emphasize your uniqueness today and you will find your natural place – at the top.|11-18-2014|pisces
343|If you feel the urge to travel today don’t let work hold you back. There will be no end of opportunities to complete outstanding tasks over the next few days, so forget about your daily schedule and have fun. You need a break from routine.|11-19-2014|pisces
344|Concentrate on what you are good at and ignore everything else. You may find that difficult to do as the planets seem determined to disrupt your routine but few signs are as focused as you once you decide what it is you desire.|11-20-2014|pisces
345|What someone tells you today may seem confusing and contradictory but if you think about it a bit you will get the message. Some people find it difficult to say things in a straightforward manner, so get out your pocket translator. |11-21-2014|pisces
346|If life is what happens to us while we are busy making other plans then what happens this weekend may come as a bit of a shock. The plans you made may not work out the way you expected, but events could still move in your favor.  |11-22-2014|pisces
347|There will be times over the coming week when you wonder why you have been singled out for so much good fortune. Do you really deserve it? Yes you do, in fact no one deserves it more. Stop putting yourself down for no reason.|11-23-2014|pisces
348|A plan to boost your earning power may be tempting but if it means doing something that leaves you feeling uncomfortable with yourself then maybe you should give it a miss. Like love, self-respect is something that money can’t buy. |11-24-2014|pisces
349|Ideas and insights are coming thick and fast but because Taurus is such a down-to-earth sign you may be reluctant to act on a hunch or a whim. But you must. The ideas and insights of today are the realities of tomorrow. |11-25-2014|pisces
350|If you come in for criticism today – and with Saturn strong in your opposite sign that is almost guaranteed – don’t react as if the world is coming to an end. There may in fact be some truth in what others are saying about you.|11-26-2014|pisces
351|No matter how many times you may have doubted your instincts in the past, don’t doubt them today. According to the planets you are in tune with the spirit of the times – and it’s about time you made it pay!|11-27-2014|pisces
352|If you try to please everyone this weekend you will end up pleasing no one, so do what feels right to you and live with the consequences. Your can-do attitude will impress others, which is nice, but you don’t have to be popular to be successful.|11-29-2014|pisces
353|Something you thought you knew all about will work out in a completely unexpected way and something you are completely in the dark about will suddenly seem so familiar. So don’t jump to conclusions – they will probably be wrong.|11-30-2014|pisces
354|The task you have to tackle over the next few days may not seem too inspiring but once you get to grips with it you will find it engages your interest more than you imagined. Who knows, you may even grow to like it! |12-01-2014|pisces
355|You cannot possibly be on good terms with everyone all of the time – even a good-natured Taurus will fall out with friends and loved ones once in a while. But it’s no big deal, so don’t beat yourself up today if harsh words are spoken. |12-02-2014|pisces
356|If someone has been taking advantage of your good nature then you must cut them out of your life. They will see you are serious and will come back with their tail between their legs begging for forgiveness. Whether you grant it is up to you.|12-03-2014|pisces
357|Do you focus on what others expect you to do, or do you focus on what you want to do? Only you can decide but you must choose one or the other – if you try to get the best of both worlds you may end up with neither.|12-04-2014|pisces
358|It will occur to you over the next 24 hours that you have been taking the wrong things seriously. Something you have been working so hard towards is most likely not worth the effort, but that’s okay – once you accept that you can make other plans.|12-05-2014|pisces
359|According to the planets you have reached the low point of your current emotional cycle and from here on things will get noticeably easier. Today’s full moon will encourage you to see your glass as half full rather than half empty.|12-06-2014|pisces
360|Don’t give yourself such a hard time over the next few days – make life easy for yourself by refusing to get worked up about trivial matters. Be warned: interfering with the natural course of events could have unnatural consequences!|12-07-2014|pisces
361|An embarrassing event will make you a bit sheepish about showing your face in certain circles but so what if you made a fool of yourself? No one is perfect, not even a Taurus, so laugh about your mistake – and others will laugh with you. |12-08-2014|pisces
362|Refuse to settle for second best in anything you do. The standards you set now are the standards you will have to live by for the next few months, so aim high, be first and don’t let anyone come between you and success. |12-09-2014|pisces
363|The restrictions you have been laboring under in recent days will fade over the next 24 hours. Your attitude will be more positive too, giving you a greater sense of freedom and making it much easier to take control of your own destiny. |12-10-2014|pisces
364|If you want to get ahead in the world then you are going to have to be a bit less thin-skinned. The kind of people who can make things happen for you are not the kind of people who worry about whose egos they might bruise, so toughen up.|12-12-2014|pisces
365|If you feel the need to apologize for something you did that was wrong now is the time. And if someone apologizes to you for something they should not have done be gracious and tell them it really doesn’t matter.|12-13-2014|pisces
366|You must not skirt around the main issue over the next few days. Work colleagues and loved ones alike will be more impressed if you tell the truth, even if what you have to say is not what they want to hear.|12-14-2014|pisces
367|You won’t find it difficult to get your own way today but don’t go too far and give others the impression that you think you are better than them. Most likely you are but you know how touchy some people get, so be subtle.|12-15-2014|pisces
368|The next 24 hours will be hectic to say the least. If you find yourself rushing all over the place but not actually getting much done maybe you should take that as a sign that you have lost control of the situation. Slow down a bit. |12-16-2014|pisces
369|Try not to be too open about what you think today or you may let slip something that could be used against you by your rivals. Your plans are your plans alone – you don’t have to broadcast them to the entire world.|12-17-2014|pisces
370|Go with the flow, even though you may not be able to see where it is taking you. What happens over the next few days may be unsettling but the planets promise you will do very well out of the changes that take place. |12-18-2014|pisces
371|You will help those who need it today but there is a danger that you will rescue someone who not only does not deserve it but will expect you to help them out every time they get in trouble. You may have to be cruel to be kind.|12-19-2014|pisces
372|As the Sun moves into one of the most outgoing and optimistic areas of your chart this weekend you can expect a lot of remarkable things to happen. If you feel you would be happier in a different environment, just get up and go.|12-20-2014|pisces
373|A more laid-back approach will work wonders this week. Certain issues may seem important to you now but what will they mean ten or twenty years down the line? Not a lot. Keep things in perspective – and remember to smile.|12-21-2014|pisces
374|You like surprises and that’s just as well because they will be arriving every few minutes over the next couple of days. Be adventurous. Be outrageous. Be the one who makes things happen. Today is the first day of the rest of your life.|12-22-2014|pisces
375|Your lust for life is amazing but try not to scatter your energy in too many directions over the next two or three days because it’s unlikely you will be able to maintain the pace for long. Focus on the one thing that matters most to you. |12-23-2014|pisces
376|A colleague will make you the kind of offer you find hard to refuse today, but can you trust them? Do what you can to find out if it is genuine and, if it is, let them know quickly that you want in on the game. |12-24-2014|pisces
377|Spend time with the people you love today. Even if you have different ideas of what makes the perfect social occasion you will still enjoy each other’s company. You may even hear some juicy gossip that you were unaware of before. |12-25-2014|pisces
378|Try not to waste money on things you do not need. It may not bother you now but looking back in a few weeks time you may regret having been so free and easy with your cash. It doesn’t grow on trees you know. |12-26-2014|pisces
379|If you need assistance with something over the next 48 hours you must ask for it. Cosmic activity in your fellow Earth sign of Capricorn encourages you to be dynamic but that does not mean you have to do things alone. |12-27-2014|pisces
380|Your beliefs are likely to change a lot over the next few weeks and soon you will be looking at life from a different angle. Things you never noticed before will suddenly come into focus and the picture you get may surprise you.|12-28-2014|pisces
381|You will have to deal with someone’s negative or emotional attitude over the next 24 hours – while making sure you don’t get negative or emotional yourself. This is one of the best times of the year for you, so don’t let anyone spoil it.|12-29-2014|pisces
382|Taurus people tend to be lucky with cash and investments and if you don’t quite believe that now you will believe it by the end of the week. If you get the chance, go into partnership with someone who complements your style. |12-30-2014|pisces
383|By all means share your dreams with other people but don’t expect much support. Whatever you say they will find ways to pick holes in it, which won’t do your confidence much good. Dream on but keep your dreams to yourself. |12-31-2014|pisces
384|Anyone who doubts you have what it takes to succeed will doubt no longer as you go all out to get the new year started in spectacular fashion. Whatever your job or career may be you want that top spot – and you are going to get it. |01-01-2015|pisces
385|If you feel the need to get up and go somewhere different today then do so. Because the approaching full moon takes place in that area of your chart associated with travel your journey is sure to be exciting – and could be educational too. |01-02-2015|pisces
386|Venus moves into the career area of your chart today, which means you will get ahead quicker if you treat life as something to be enjoyed rather than as a constant battle. If you’re not smiling then you’re not doing it right. |01-03-2015|pisces
387|Don’t make too many changes over the next two or three days because you will probably have to change them back again towards the end of the week. It’s not like you to be impulsive, so why start now? |01-04-2015|pisces
388|You don’t have to apologize for something you said that rubbed a friend or relative up the wrong way. It works both ways: they’ve said plenty of things that annoyed you over the years which you chose not to make an issue of. |01-05-2015|pisces
389|No matter how big your problems may seem to you now, in the greater scheme of things they are of little importance, so stop worrying and start smiling again. If you can afford the time and money this is a good time to take a vacation. |01-06-2015|pisces
390|A colleague you thought you could rely on will say something today that makes you realize they are not on your side after all. End the association if you think that’s the right thing to do – and next time don’t be so gullible. |01-07-2015|pisces
391|Neptune, planet of deception, warns you need to treat what you hear today with the utmost suspicion. That may sound rather negative but according to the planets someone is trying to put ideas in your head that do not belong there.|01-08-2015|pisces
392|You will be dealing with important people today, the kind of people who can make things happen. The trick is to get them to make things happen for you. If you get the chance to impress them, take it. There’s no point being shy. |01-09-2015|pisces
393|Don’t let anyone take decisions for you this weekend because most likely they will get them wrong and leave you to clear up the mess. If a matter is important to you then you should be prepared to be decisive about it.|01-10-2015|pisces
394|There are some rather wild ideas flying around at the moment, the kind of ideas that could cause trouble if you are foolish enough to act on them. Keep a clear head and keep away from people who are too easily carried away.|01-11-2015|pisces
395|This is a great day for meeting with friends and engaging in activities that make you glad to be alive. On the career front, your ambitions may seem lofty to some but you know that anything is possible if you want it enough – and you do. |01-12-2015|pisces
396|You will notice someone today who for some reason you never noticed before. Which only goes to show how easy it is to miss things, and people, unless you are actually looking for them. What other things have you overlooked? |01-13-2015|pisces
397|There are a lot of people out there who could benefit from your brand of kindness, so start looking for ways you can assist them. Charity work would be especially rewarding – it would thrill you to see your efforts help those in need. |01-14-2015|pisces
398|Don’t worry too much if you fall out with a friend today because it’s really no big deal. It could even be beneficial in that you may need to clear the air and this is as good a time as any. Tomorrow you’ll be best buddies again.|01-15-2015|pisces
399|No matter what sad tales you hear from other people today you will be on a high. As far as you are concerned the world is, was and always will be a wonderful place. Hold on to that feeling as long as you can. |01-16-2015|pisces
400|What happens over the next 48 hours will in some way change your life. But will it change it for the better or for the worse? That depends on your goals. If you get the choice between making money and helping someone, do the latter. |01-17-2015|pisces
401|If you are under pressure now it can only be because you are putting yourself under pressure. Your ambitions will rise dramatically over the next few days but don’t expect too much of yourself too soon – take it a step at a time. |01-18-2015|pisces
402|You will either impress some very important people today or you will upset some very important people – there is no middle ground. This is a hugely important time for your career and reputation, so get noticed for the right reasons. |01-19-2015|pisces
403|If you find yourself under pressure today it can only be because you are putting yourself under pressure. You may be intensely ambitious but don’t expect too much too soon. A step at a time will get you where you need to go. |01-20-2015|pisces
404|You may find it hard getting through to a friend or a family member today but it’s no big deal so don’t worry about it. Chances are they don’t want to hear what you have to say, at least not at the moment, so don’t press it. |01-21-2015|pisces
405|You may think that a friend is holding out on you in some way, and maybe they are, but is it important? Pretend you have not noticed and let them get away with it. If a small victory makes them happy, let them have it.|01-22-2015|pisces
406|You will get along with people in positions of authority remarkably well today and if you need a favor then now is the time to ask. But don’t let it go to your head – yes, it is possible to ask for too much.|01-23-2015|pisces
407|You will have to deal with someone today who, to put it mildly, rubs you up the wrong way. Be that as it may they have something which you need, so be nice to them, at least until you’ve got what you want! |01-24-2015|pisces
408|A business matter may cause you some anxiety over the next few days but the planets indicate it’s not worth getting too excited about. Venus, your ruler, moves in your favor on Tuesday, and you may be on the move as well. |01-25-2015|pisces
409|Be careful what you say today because if you leave any doubt about your meaning someone could take your words the wrong way and cause a scene. Polish up your communication skills – you will need them on the work front. |01-26-2015|pisces
410|You may have to do something that does not go down well with loved ones today but you know it must be done and will ignore any criticism that comes your way. Sometimes your stubborn streak can be hugely beneficial!|01-27-2015|pisces
411|Don’t let a friendship suffer over a money issue that is of no real importance. It may seem a big deal to you now but in a matter of days you will realize it wasn’t worth the time or the energy you invested in it. |01-28-2015|pisces
412|Stand up for what you believe in and refuse to change your ways or your views simply to please those in positions of authority. Freedom of speech is a right well worth fighting for, so by all means pick a battle today. |01-29-2015|pisces
413|The planets are urging you to be open and friendly and show the world you have nothing to hide – even if you actually have plenty to hide! Pretend you don’t have a care in the world and others will be taken in by your act. |01-30-2015|pisces
414|You have been a bit free and easy with your spending in recent weeks and now would be a good time to cut back and, ideally, find some new sources of income. Don’t wait until you are forced to act – act now. |01-31-2015|pisces
415|You will get the chance to make friends with someone in a position of power this week. But don’t think you have to flatter them and agree with every word they say. What they like most about you is that you speak your mind. |02-01-2015|pisces
416|You must put your own needs first over the next few days, not for selfish reasons but because if you don’t you will lose out to people who are not as talented or deserving of success as you. Be bold and be the best.|02-02-2015|pisces
417|You need to get rid of all that emotional junk that is clogging up your life. Be ruthless with yourself – if you let your heart continue to rule your head you won’t get rid of half as much stuff as you should.|02-03-2015|pisces
418|You will take risks purely for the fun of it today, not really caring if you win or lose. The good news is you will win nine times out of ten, and on the one occasion when you do lose it will only be a minor setback. |02-04-2015|pisces
419|You must tell the truth today, even if it hurts the feelings of people you love. It will hurt them a lot more in the long-term if they discover they were the only ones who did not know what was going on. |02-05-2015|pisces
420|It might not be a good idea to speak from the heart over the next 24 hours, not with some of the negative opinions you have about certain people. A day or two from now your attitude will be a lot more positive. |02-06-2015|pisces
421|You will be in a party mood over the next 48 hours. You certainly won’t be too serious about life. People who say you should be working and making money are the kind of people you need most to avoid.|02-07-2015|pisces
422|If you are the kind of Taurus who prefers to stay out of the limelight the next few days could be a bit uncomfortable. Like it or not you are going to be in the spotlight, so maybe you should learn to enjoy the attention.|02-08-2015|pisces
423|The people you will have to deal with today respect facts and figures, so show them your plans and let them know how you can make them work. If they think you know what you are talking about they will support you to the hilt. |02-09-2015|pisces
424|You have set your heart on doing something and you intend to see it through to the end, no matter what the critics might say. You know what you want and you know how to get it, so what are you waiting for? |02-10-2015|pisces
425|Others will go out of their way to keep you quiet today, because the truth is not what they want to hear. If you find yourself at odds with people in positions of power, don’t back down. Your have right on your side. |02-11-2015|pisces
426|Don’t be discouraged if today’s events throw your plans into disarray. One way or another most people around you will be dealing with chaos and confusion over the next 24 hours, so you won’t stand out from the crowd. |02-12-2015|pisces
427|You will see or hear something to your advantage over the next 24 hours, something that can have a positive effect on your career. What that something may be is impossible to say but you will know it when you see it.|02-13-2015|pisces
428|Most of the time you are a really tough negotiator but today and tomorrow you will go right the other way and let someone have for free what would usually cost them a great deal of money. It’s a one off, of course.|02-14-2015|pisces
429|You may have high ideals but do you live up to them? That is the question you will be asking yourself over the next few days and being the honest sort you will have to admit that sometimes you don’t. But you will in future! |02-15-2015|pisces
430|Your opinions on a number of issues will change profoundly over the next few days. New information will come your way that makes some of your most cherished convictions look rather out of date. Don’t cling to the past for the sake of it. |02-16-2015|pisces
431|There are times when it pays to be blunt and this is one of them. Others won’t mind what kind of language you use today so long as they understand where you are coming from and what you expect them to do next. |02-17-2015|pisces
432|Focus on your dreams and wishes and don’t worry if they seem a bit far-fetched. Today’s new moon makes all things possible, so aim high and, who knows, maybe it won’t be long before your dreams and wishes become realities. |02-18-2015|pisces
433|This is a good day for thinking but not such a good day for making decisions. Whatever you decide over the next 24 hours you are likely to have second thoughts about it come the weekend, so keep your options open as much as you can.|02-19-2015|pisces
434|If you can’t get what you want over the next 24 hours you will get the chance to make up for it tomorrow. As usual the only thing you have to fear is fear itself, so tell yourself you can do anything you want – and believe it.|02-20-2015|pisces
435|The only danger at the moment is that you will either set your sights too high or set them too low. You need to recognize both what your talents and your limitations happen to be and decide on your goals according to that. |02-21-2015|pisces
436|Opportunities will come your way over the next few days, so make the effort to get out and about and make things happen. Something you say or do when Venus, your ruler, links with Saturn on Tuesday could make you some serious money. |02-22-2015|pisces
437|Some people may say you are being too cautious, especially with money, but your sixth sense tells you this is not a good time to splash out. If there is something you really want get a friend or family member to buy it for you. |02-23-2015|pisces
438|Don’t worry if you find it hard to communicate with those around you over the next 24 hours – it may be the planets’ way of telling you this is not a good time to discuss serious matters. You will open up more later in the week.|02-24-2015|pisces
439|Ignore those you don’t get along with today and spend your time with people whose beliefs are in tune with your own. Group and social activities will go extremely well over the next few days, especially if you stick with your friends. |02-25-2015|pisces
440|According to the planets you will be taking on a lot more duties and responsibilities over the next few weeks. That may not be what you were hoping to hear but it will, in the long-term, earn you more respect – and more money too.|02-26-2015|pisces
441|You will go out of your way to calm someone down today but your efforts may not be enough. The fact is their emotions are a bit raw at the moment, so make allowances and don’t take what they say about you too seriously.|02-27-2015|pisces
442|Don’t say one thing while meaning another. And don’t give partners and loved ones the impression that you agree with them when you do not. State the truth as you see it and, if others don’t like it, debate the issue in a civilized way.|02-28-2015|pisces
443|You cannot fool people who know you well. With that fact in mind don’t try to tell a partner or loved one something that isn’t true, because they won’t believe you for a moment. You have a reputation for honesty – don’t lose it. |03-01-2015|pisces
444|Don’t worry if others say you are too conservative and don’t take enough risks. That’s nonsense. You know who you are and what you can do and if you follow your instincts over the coming week you will go much further than your critics. |03-02-2015|pisces
445|Don’t listen to your own doubts and fears today because they will cloud your mind and prevent you from reaching your true potential. And that would be a shame because there are so many things you could be winning at now.|03-03-2015|pisces
446|Someone will expect you to live up to the inflated image they have of you today but if you try you may come unstuck. Be who you are and do what you do and insist that everyone you know takes you as they find you.|03-04-2015|pisces
447|Chances are you will totally and utterly disagree with the advice you are given today. You could be right – maybe it is a complete load of nonsense – but what if it isn’t and you are the only one who doesn’t act on it?|03-05-2015|pisces
448|If someone gives you a hard time today don’t take it to heart: most likely they just need to let off steam and you happen to be the closest target. If you stay calm and in control they will make it up to you big time tomorrow.|03-06-2015|pisces
449|You have so much energy at your disposal right now that you could do a dozen things at once and still leave something in reserve. However, if you hold fire and wait until Monday or Tuesday you will discover a goal more worthy of your talents.|03-07-2015|pisces
450|You may feel sorry for someone who is going through hard times but, of course, they have only themselves to blame. Help them out by all means but let them know too that sooner or later they are going to have to get their act together.|03-08-2015|pisces
451|Don’t take someone’s negative remarks to heart because either they don’t mean what they say or they don’t realize how offensive it sounds to you. The last thing you need now is a slanging match with someone who should be your friend. |03-09-2015|pisces
452|The answers you seek are easy to find but you need to ask the right questions too. Take a look at the world around you. Who is in charge? Who is calling the shots? Answer that and everything else will fall into place.|03-10-2015|pisces
453|There is someone you are desperate to get to know better but can’t think of a way to make your approach. Don’t worry. What happens today will throw you together and before you know it you will be more than just friends.|03-11-2015|pisces
454|Take a long hard look at your financial position and decide what steps need to be taken to improve your long-term security. Earning more money would help, of course, but your main priority now is to cut back on luxuries and unnecessary expenses.|03-12-2015|pisces
455|What you expect to happen today and over the weekend most likely won’t, while what you don’t expect to happen most likely will. In which case there is no point making plans as they are certain to change. Take life as it comes. |03-13-2015|pisces
456|A work colleague will say something unfriendly today and to say you’re not happy about it is a bit of an understatement. But before you respond in kind make sure you have heard them correctly – it could be you who has the wrong end of the stick.|03-14-2015|pisces
457|You have been moving in the wrong direction and realize you will have to backtrack and find the point where you strayed off the path you were supposed to go down. On the other hand, some say all roads lead eventually to the same destination! |03-15-2015|pisces
458|You may be eager to push ahead with a project you know in your bones will be a success but the planets warn the timing is not quite right. At the very least wait until the solar eclipse on Friday – it will give you the boost you need. |03-16-2015|pisces
459|Promise yourself that you won’t get annoyed if certain people get on your nerves over the next few days. Most likely the real problem isn’t them but you and the closer you get to Friday’s eclipse the more sensitive you will be.|03-17-2015|pisces
460|Everyone has faults, everyone has failings, but not everyone has the strength to deal with them. But you do. The planets make it easy to confront the negative aspects of your personality now, so face up to them and overcome them.|03-18-2015|pisces
461|Friends and family are both on your mind at the moment but they are unlikely to mix, so focus on one and catch up on the other later on. The last thing you want over the next few days is a clash of personalities to deal with. |03-19-2015|pisces
462|If someone blames you for something that was not your fault by all means let them know you are not happy about it, but don’t go to extremes and make an enemy of them. Think before you speak – it could save you a lot of bother. |03-20-2015|pisces
463|You feel that your ideas are not being taken seriously but don’t worry because you will get the chance to prove yourself in weeks to come. This weekend though, keep telling yourself that you are on the right track – because you are. |03-21-2015|pisces
464|While everyone else is rushing here, there and everywhere trying to get things done today you will be strolling along without a care in the world. Either you have missed something important or maybe you’re the only one with the right attitude. |03-22-2015|pisces
465|There seems to be a lot of self doubt in your mind, which is not like you at all. Prove to yourself that you have what it takes to succeed by taking the sort of risk you would usually avoid. Take a chance – and be a star. |03-23-2015|pisces
466|Venus in your sign means you can get almost anything you want – and if you don’t believe that now you will before the day is over. However, go easy with the cash and the cards because you are also in one of your spendthrift moods.|03-24-2015|pisces
467|Venus in your sign makes the world look a kinder place, but don’t be fooled. Your attitude to those around you may have softened but you still need to take care, especially when dealing with money-related issues. Don’t be an easy touch. |03-25-2015|pisces
468|It is slowly but surely all coming right for you and over the next few days you will benefit in ways you cannot yet imagine. With Venus, your ruler, moving through your birth sign you cannot possibly lose, in love or in luck.|03-26-2015|pisces
469|Forget about financial matters and focus on your family. Get things in perspective today and remind yourself that, in the greater scheme of things, money is only bits of paper. Your own flesh and blood is, and always will be, more important.|03-27-2015|pisces
470|Don’t worry if a loved one is difficult to get along with this weekend – most likely they are going through a period of self-doubt and there is nothing much you can do about it. Give them space. They will get over it soon.|03-28-2015|pisces
471|However much you don’t feel like getting stuck into your workload you know if you don’t make a start now it may never get done. Someone in a position of authority is watching you closely – make sure they like what they see.|03-29-2015|pisces
472|You are trying to make sense of something that makes no sense at all, so it is no wonder you are getting frustrated. You don’t need to find an explanation for everything that happens in life. Some puzzles are best left unsolved. |03-30-2015|pisces
473|What happens today should be seen as the culmination of all the efforts you have made over the past few months. And even if you have not made much of an effort something will happen that brings a smile to your face. |03-31-2015|pisces
474|The pace of life will pick up over the next few days and that’s good news because you have been operating well below capacity. With Mars in your sign you will find it ridiculously easy to get things done – but get others to help you too.|04-01-2015|pisces
475|You will say the right thing in the right way today, especially when dealing with people in positions of power. However, you don’t need to boast about how good you are. If they don’t know already they will learn over the next few days.|04-02-2015|pisces
476|What is the one thing you desire above everything else? If you know what it is and if you have the confidence to go after it there is every chance you will get it over the next few days. But only you can make it happen.|04-03-2015|pisces
477|You may not be getting the support and encouragement you need at the moment but don’t worry about it. It simply means that those you live and work with have a lot on their minds this weekend. Maybe you should be supporting them.|04-04-2015|pisces
478|The last few days have been hectic and if you are smart you will now slow down a bit and make sure your physical, metal and emotional batteries are recharged. If you don’t it won’t be long before you are showing signs of fatigue. |04-05-2015|pisces
479|The less others know about your aims and ambitions this week the better, especially if you are working towards a goal that is likely to make others jealous if you succeed – and you will. The less your rivals know about it the better.|04-06-2015|pisces
480|You may be tempted to give up on something that is not working out the way you expected but is that wise? The planets urge you to stick with it a while longer because a breakthrough is imminent. If you give up now you will regret it later.|04-07-2015|pisces
481|Try not to change things for the sake of it over the next 24 hours. According to the planets you are thinking of altering something simply because others have been criticizing you for being too traditional. They’re right, you are – but so what?|04-08-2015|pisces
482|Either you will set your sights too high or set them too low over the next 24 hours. You could, of course, surprise everyone and find a sensible middle way but how likely is that? You’re in one of your “take it to the limit” moods!|04-09-2015|pisces
483|If you have a good idea today you must let others know about it, especially those who can support you and guide you. Don’t keep your biggest and best ideas to yourself: sharing what you know is always good business. |04-10-2015|pisces
484|Changing methods and routines is rarely easy but the current cosmic outlook makes it simpler than usual, for you at least. Whatever changes you think are necessary you should get on with them now. There’s no time like the present.|04-11-2015|pisces
485|Don’t worry too much if something happens over the next few days that throws your plans into disarray. Everyone around you will be dealing with chaos and confusion. The good news is that you will deal with it better than most.|04-12-2015|pisces
486|The Sun in Aries at this time of year tends to bring forth self-doubt but the good news is that the Sun will be moving into your sign in a week’s time and then your confidence will return. Between now and then, keep a low profile. |04-13-2015|pisces
487|You are in no mood to follow the herd. With mind planet Mercury moving into your sign you will go your own way and do your own thing even if the whole world is against you. You’ll make a big impression, and a good one too.|04-14-2015|pisces
488|You have been worrying too much about money and business matters lately but as from today your fears should subside a little. The moment you stop worrying about your cash flow situation is the moment it will start getting better.|04-15-2015|pisces
489|A few days from now the Sun will move into your birth sign and a new solar year will begin, so try not to start anything new. Conserve your energy today and over the weekend – because you are going to need it very soon. |04-17-2015|pisces
490|The Sun remains in the most introspective area of your chart only until Monday, so put aside some time over the next 48 hours for quiet contemplation and to consider your options. It could be the most important weekend of the year.|04-18-2015|pisces
491|It’s not often you splash out on gifts for other people but with the Sun moving into your sign today you are in an optimistic, and therefore generous, mood. Don’t go too mad though – your resources are limited after all.|04-20-2015|pisces
492|It’s time to finish those tasks that should have been completed a long time ago. The Sun in your sign means your energy levels will peak over the next few days, so get on top of your workload so you can stop worrying about it.|04-21-2015|pisces
493|You will have plenty to say for yourself today and as far as some people are concerned you are saying too much. But that’s too bad because you have kept your thoughts to yourself long enough – now you intend to make up for lost time.|04-22-2015|pisces
494|With the Sun in your sign your confidence is high but you still have a vague feeling that everything could fall apart at any moment. Don’t worry, it won’t, but it could be your intuition is trying to tell you something. What could it be?|04-23-2015|pisces
495|If you are happy with your life as it is then don’t change a thing, no matter how hard others try to persuade you to set new goals. You are at your best when you know where you stand. Security is more important to you than ambition. |04-24-2015|pisces
496|You may be the life and soul of the party at the moment but some of the people you interact with this weekend won’t be in the mood for fun and games. Don’t get in their way but don’t let them get in your way either. |04-25-2015|pisces
497|All things are possible for you now but for best results you should focus on just one or two aims. If you spread yourself too thin your energy and enthusiasm will be used up quickly and your excitement will wane quickly too. |04-26-2015|pisces
498|There will be a clash of egos as the new week begins and although you won’t be directly involved you will be affected. Under no circumstances agree to take sides, because even if you choose right you will lose out in some way.|04-27-2015|pisces
499|You are full of energy and enthusiasm now but that does not mean you should throw caution to the wind. By all means be bold today but have a goal too, something you can work towards, if only by indirect means.|04-28-2015|pisces
500|Let your mind roam where it will over the next 24 hours. Give yourself permission to dream. The dreams you have may seem far-fetched to some but chances are it won’t be long before they are no longer dreams but realities.|04-29-2015|pisces
501|You have come a long way in a short space of time and will go even further over the next few weeks. But first you must slow down a bit and make sure you are still on the right track. Don’t lose sight of your long-term goals.|04-30-2015|pisces
502|The more others try to change your way of looking at things the more you will dig in your heels, and you are right to resist. Only you know what is best for you and your instincts tell you this is a time for consolidation, not change.|05-01-2015|pisces
503|Try not to take what you hear to heart over the next 48 hours. It may be true that someone is trying to make you feel bad – most likely because it makes them feel good – but you are under no obligation to play their silly games.|05-02-2015|pisces
504|Make your plans and make them big – but keep them secret too. If you are too eager to show the world how smart you are then you might let slip something that boosts your rivals’ chances of success at the expense of your own. |05-03-2015|pisces
505|Strive to be nice to people today, even if they are not always nice to you. A full moon in your opposite sign of Scorpio will help you realize that people everywhere are much the same – if not quite as brilliant as you. |05-04-2015|pisces
506|Some people think you are lazy but that’s far from the truth. It’s just that you see no point exerting yourself for things that are of no importance. It’s better to be ambitious about one thing than lukewarm about many things.|05-05-2015|pisces
507|You will get the chance to climb several rungs up the ladder of success over the next few days but there is also a danger that you could slip and fall all the way to the bottom. It’s all part of the game – smile whatever happens. |05-06-2015|pisces
508|Do something different over the next 24 hours, something that those who believe you are traditional by nature would never guess you are capable of. The fact is you have been far too predictable of late. It’s time to get yourself noticed.|05-07-2015|pisces
509|Make the most of Mars in your sign to get things done and let the people you live and work with know that you won’t be pushed around. You don’t have to be aggressive about it but you do have to protect your interests.|05-08-2015|pisces
510|You could easily go over the top and make claims or statements you don’t know to be true over the next 48 hours. You may think that does not matter but the planets warn it could cost you dear, so watch what you say.|05-09-2015|pisces
511|Over the next few days you will find that some things that usually come easy to you will need extra care and extra effort. Most importantly you must take care with money as impulse buying could lead you astray in a big and costly way. |05-10-2015|pisces
512|Mars leaves your birth sign tomorrow, so if there is anything that needs finishing you should knuckle down and get on with it now. Your efforts will not go unrecognized or unrewarded – the powers that be have been watching. |05-11-2015|pisces
513|Mars leaves your sign today but that does not mean you can no longer be positive. On the contrary, in some areas you can be even more positive than usual. Material issues generally and money matters in particular are doubly important now.|05-12-2015|pisces
514|Loved ones will leave you in no doubt at all what they think and feel over the next two or three days. The good news is that what they desire is most likely what you desire too, so this could turn out to be a week to remember!|12-01-2013|pisces
515|Honesty is the best policy today, especially if you have done something that makes you feel bad about yourself. Own up and have done with it – you will most likely be amazed how quickly partners and loved ones forgive you.|12-02-2013|pisces
516|Optimism is generally a good thing but too much can be dangerous. The planets warn you must make an effort to see things as they are today, not as how you dream they might be. That applies especially to partnerships matters.|12-03-2013|pisces
517|Someone in a position of power thinks you’re pretty special and if you are smart you will play up to it and make it pay. Use your way with words to get a promotion or a pay rise. If you’re really smart you might even get both.|12-04-2013|pisces
518|Partners and loved ones will be full of themselves today and you may find it hard to get a word in edgeways. But that’s okay – let them chatter all they like. Give the impression you are listening, even if your mind is far away. |12-05-2013|pisces
519|You may be under pressure to apologize for something you said to a friend or colleague but is that wise? Not if you truly meant it. Besides, why give them the impression that you can be easily swayed? That’s asking for trouble.|12-06-2013|pisces
520|Try not to be hurt or see it as a sign of rejection if a friend or work colleague tells you they want to go it alone. Not only will it be good for them but it will be good for you as well. And you won’t have to share the glory!|12-07-2013|pisces
521|Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Sagittarius may make it appear as if everyone but you is having fun but that is an illusion brought about by your negative attitude. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and start making things happen. |12-08-2013|pisces
522|You may have to be cruel to be kind today. The planets indicate that someone you are close to emotionally needs to be reminded that they can’t always have things their own way. It’s in their interests that they get the message.|12-09-2013|pisces
523|You seem to be getting through a lot of work of late, which is good, but you won’t be able to keep up this pace indefinitely, so start thinking of ways you can ease back a little. You need to stay sharp both mentally and physically.|12-10-2013|pisces
524|If someone asks for your opinion on a personal matter you will be happy to give it. However, if your sixth sense tells you they won’t be happy hearing the truth maybe you should decline their request. Let them work it out for themselves.|12-11-2013|pisces
525|Your thoughts seem to be a bit heavy at the moment and there are certainly one or two areas where you need to get serious. But don’t get so serious that all the fun goes out of your life. If it makes you smile it’s got to be right.|12-12-2013|pisces
526|It may seem to others that you never lack confidence but that’s not always true and as the Sun moves through your opposite sign there will be times when self-doubt begins to bite. What do you do? You bite back – and hard!|12-13-2013|pisces
527|The next few days should be productive but they will be more productive still if you take the time and make the effort to end one particular existing project that is holding you back. Some things are not destined to be completed.|12-14-2013|pisces
528|Your emotions will be all over the place over the next two or three days and come Tuesday, when the moon is full in your sign, you could easily go over the top and say or do things that turn others against you. Self-control is a must.|12-15-2013|pisces
529|You may have to bluff your way through the sort of situation you would usually cope with quite easily today. Fortunately others expect you to be confident and outspoken so you will carry it off and no one will be any the wiser.|12-16-2013|pisces
530|The full moon in your sign suggests that at least one and maybe several challenges are heading your way and it is important that you face up to them. Don’t let anyone bully you, not even once, or they will never leave you alone.|12-17-2013|pisces
531|Money matters may be causing you concern but other aspects indicate you can still have lots of fun. Besides, if you keep too tight a hold of the purse strings now you may have to spend more later in the month. Get the balance right.|12-18-2013|pisces
532|Partnerships of all kinds have been under the spotlight of late and will remain so until the Sun moves out of your opposite sign this weekend. You can though still put your number one relationship on a firmer footing. Do it now. |12-19-2013|pisces
533|You don’t have to be nice to people just because you want to spare their feelings. If there is something that needs to be said, something that might give offence, then give it to them straight. A dose of reality will do them good.|12-20-2013|pisces
534|The Sun now moves into the area of your chart that governs wealth and investments, so you need to think clearly and seriously about your long-term financial prospects. At the very least you should start saving for that proverbial rainy day.|12-21-2013|pisces
535|You must do your own research when it comes to money matters and business deals. If you let others decide things for you almost certainly they will get it wrong, so make the effort and make sure you stay in control.|12-22-2013|pisces
536|Don’t get uptight if someone you live or work with points out where you are going wrong. In fact you should thank them. Even a Gemini can make mistakes, so take it in your stride, learn from your error and do better next time.|12-23-2013|pisces
537|You will have to take on new responsibilities over the next few days, including some of a financial nature. Make a serious effort. Show the world you have what it takes to handle difficult situations. And yes, you can still have fun.|12-24-2013|pisces
538|It’s okay to be suspicious but the planets warn you could take it too far today. Just because someone changes their plans at the last moment does not mean they are trying to make life difficult for you, at least not on purpose.|12-25-2013|pisces
539|You are who you are for a reason, so why wish you were someone else? If you stop wasting time fantasizing about who you would like to be and focus on making a better job of who you are you will soon be both successful and happy.|12-26-2013|pisces
540|If you tend to worry a lot then what happens today and tomorrow will make you feel better about what has been going on in your life. Most importantly you will realize that maintaining a positive mental attitude is a must.|12-27-2013|pisces
541|Times may be tough on the cash front but what happens this weekend will remind you how well off you really are. It’s not what you’ve got in terms of money and possessions that matters but how much love you give and receive.|12-28-2013|pisces
542|Resist the urge to resort to underhand methods to get what you want this week. Even if your motives are pure it is your tactics you will be remembered by, so play by the rules and set an example. The ends do not justify the means.|12-29-2013|pisces
543|The current cosmic set-up makes certain things look worse than they actually are, so don’t overreact if you don’t get what you want today. In the long-term, as always, you will get exactly what you need, so why worry?|12-30-2013|pisces
544|No one expects you to be perfect, so don’t expect it of yourself. With Mercury, your ruler, linked to Pluto you may have to hold up your hand and admit that you made a mistake. In the greater scheme of things it’s of no importance. |12-31-2013|pisces
545|What happens today may take you by surprise but it will be in a nice way. Why have you been singled out for so much good fortune? Because at some point in the past you put yourself out for other people – now they are returning the favor.|01-01-2014|pisces
546|Don’t let other people’s doubts stop you frompushing ahead with a plan you knowhas the potential to make you both happy and successful. Just because they don’t know how to dream does not mean you have to give up on your own.|01-02-2014|pisces
547|It seems you have been talking at cross purposes with a loved one and that is why you have not been getting along. According to the planets it is time to sit down and be honest with one another. Yes, of course you can be friends again.|01-03-2014|pisces
548|Things will seem a lot clearer once you’ve got this weekend out of the way, so bide your time and don’t be tempted to make any major decisions just yet. If you find it hard to work out who you can trust, then simply trust no one!|01-04-2014|pisces
549|You will soon start feeling better about your long-term financial prospects, so don’t worry about the small stuff. But don’t take anything for granted either: if you splash out on unnecessary luxuries now you will most likely regret it later.|01-05-2014|pisces
550|It will pay you to not be quite so open about what you are doing and why. You don’t have to be dishonest but you do have to keep information that could be useful to rivals and enemies to yourself. This is not a time for sharing.|01-06-2014|pisces
551|The planets suggest that if you make an effort today it will pay off. The only problem is you are not in the mood to do anything too strenuous. That’s okay — you don’t have to exert yourself. But don’t blame others for your lack of progress. |01-07-2014|pisces
552|It may appear as if someone is being deliberately obstructive, and maybe they are, but you should also ask yourself if there was something you said or did that could have turned them against you. If so, it’s not too late to say sorry.|01-08-2014|pisces
553|Few things in life are black or white but today you will know what is right and what is wrong and which course of action you should be taking. If you choose not to take it the consequences in the long-term may not be to your liking.|01-09-2014|pisces
554|The first step toward resolving a problem is to recognize that there is a problem, and that is the step you must take today. For too long you have ignored the warning signs in the hope that they might be wrong, but they’re not.|01-10-2014|pisces
555||01-11-2014|pisces
556|The approaching full moon warns you must watch what you say and, if you do go over the top, apologize immediately. Do whatever it takes to stay on good terms with loved ones and relatives. Your security may depend on it.|01-12-2014|pisces
557|Your values will change in important ways over the next few days, especially in how you look at money and possessions. What you need to learn is that it’s not what you own and earn that counts but what you do with what you’ve got.|01-13-2014|pisces
558|You will be even more assertive than usual today, and that’s good, but don’t be so assertive that you scare people away. The way to win others round to your way of thinking is to persuade them with facts, not intimidate them with threats.|01-14-2014|pisces
559|You may lose your temper with someone who lets you down or disrupts your plans. But don’t feel bad about it because you are not the only one whose emotions are up in the air at the moment. Even Geminis get annoyed once in a while.|01-15-2014|pisces
560|Your ideas are as good as anyone else’s ideas but for some reason you seem to think you are not as smart as your rivals. It may be true they have fewer self-doubts but where intelligence is concerned you are way out in front.|01-16-2014|pisces
561|Have faith in your dreams and don’t listen to those who say you are too far out with your ideas for your own good. They may think you are mad but it all makes perfect sense to you, and ultimately that’s the only thing that matters.|01-17-2014|pisces
562|Two days from now the Sun moves into one of the most favorable areas of your chart, so there is every reason why you should feel happy about your prospects. Put worries and woes behind you and get ready to have some fun.|01-18-2014|pisces
563|This could be and should be one of the best times of the year for you. Yes, okay, so the year has barely started but if you play your cards right you will look back on the next few days with fondness for many months to come.|01-19-2014|pisces
564|You may be tempted to bend the rules but if you do you will regret it towards the end of the week when Mercury, your ruler, squares up to Saturn. One of the best times of the year is about to begin – you don’t need to cut corners.|01-20-2014|pisces
565|Don’t waste time telling the world what you are going to do – just get on and do it. You should be aiming higher than ever before. Nothing is beyond you. Nothing is impossible. If you want something enough you can make it happen.|01-21-2014|pisces
566|Certain people may be feeling down but they have no right to bring you down with them, so go somewhere there is music playing and people dancing and not a sad face to be seen. Do whatever it takes to keep your mood light.|01-22-2014|pisces
567|The important thing now is that you keep your eyes fixed on the bigger picture and don’t allow yourself to be distracted by events that get in the way of your goals. You can still be sociable and have fun but you’ve got to be focused too.|01-23-2014|pisces
568|You don’t have to be especially dynamic today. In fact, if you sit back and wait for good things to come your way they surely will. Also, your way with words will get what you desire in most situations. Who could even think of denying you!|01-24-2014|pisces
569|Don’t be so eager to improve your money position that you start taking the kind of risks that are best avoided. Make a conscious effort not to panic, because if you panic you will do something silly and it may cost you a fortune.|01-25-2014|pisces
570|You will be tempted to go to extremes this week and maybe, just maybe, it’s the right thing to do. The planets will protect you in most situations but even when you do get into trouble you will talk your way out of it with ease.|01-26-2014|pisces
571|Listen to your instincts today because they are sharper than ever. If your inner voice tells you one thing while the so-called experts tell you another then you can bet your bottom dollar they have got it wrong. Trust yourself – always.|01-27-2014|pisces
572|Make an effort to see things as they are, unclouded by wishful thinking or negative expectations. The planets indicate you can achieve more now than at just about any other time, so long as you keep your aims within reasonable bounds.|01-28-2014|pisces
573|A friendship that has been on a downward spiral of late will pick up again. This time, make sure it stays up. You will have to accept that — in certain areas — you have and always will have different points of view.|01-29-2014|pisces
574|If other people want to take control and decide what you are going to do together you should let them. Today’s new moon means you can afford to sit back and let partners make the difficult decisions. Whatever they decide, you will benefit.|01-30-2014|pisces
575|Despite what some negative types might say most people in the world are just like you. Keep that fact in mind today when dealing with strangers. Get to know them better. You may be surprised how much you have in common.|01-31-2014|pisces
576|Today’s Sun-Jupiter link could cause you to go to extremes in some way. Nothing much is likely to come of it but you may find yourself out of pocket if, on someone else’s advice, you take risks with your cash. So don’t.|02-01-2014|pisces
577|You will have to deal with a challenge to your authority that could be quite serious. Don’t try to put it off, because the longer you leave it the more serious it will get. Make sure everyone knows who is the boss – and that’s you.|02-03-2014|pisces
578|Information will come your way today that enables you to put one over on a rival. All is fair in love and war so don’t hesitate to use what you learn for your own benefit. They would do the same if the roles were reversed.|02-04-2014|pisces
579|If you want to impress people in positions of authority, you had better be quick because as from tomorrow it won’t be so easy. Maybe you should give up trying so hard and just impress the one person who really counts — yourself. |02-05-2014|pisces
580|You have thought long and hard about what you are planning and all you need to do now is get on with it. Don’t worry that certain people may not approve – that is the least of your worries. Most likely they’re jealous of you.|02-06-2014|pisces
581|Whatever you do for a living, the changes you make on the work front over the next few days will have huge effects over the coming months, so think carefully and, if there is any doubt, leave things as they are for the time being.|02-07-2014|pisces
582|You have finally grown tired of an association that has had a lot more ups than downs, and now you are ready to call it a day. There may be a few regrets, but deep down you know this is one relationship you are better off without.|02-08-2014|pisces
583|Mars in Libra endows you with amazing levels of energy and huge self-belief. However, no matter how confident you feel you would be wise not to take risks or take anything for granted. Know your limits and stay within them.|02-10-2014|pisces
584|The answer to your money worries will appear soon, so stay calm and don’t do anything drastic. Sacrifices will have to be made but they won’t cause you too much pain, so long as you use your head — and the talents you were born with. |02-11-2014|pisces
585|It’s time to get serious about your ambitions. The winds of fate can blow you only so far – once you reach a certain point you have to get ahead on your own. What motivates you? What do you most wish to accomplish? Go for it!|02-12-2014|pisces
586|As your ruler Mercury begins one of its retrograde phases today you need to be on your guard. It’s quite likely that someone will try to cheat you in some way – but now that you know that it won’t be so easy. Don’t be too trusting.|02-13-2014|pisces
587|Today’s full moon makes minor disputes seem bigger and more important than they actually are, but now that you know that you can make a conscious effort not to take what you see and hear too seriously. If it’s not fun it’s not worth it.|02-14-2014|pisces
588|You may be swamped with offers at the moment but you cannot possibly accept them all, so be smart and choose the two or three that are most likely to take you towards your goal in the quickest time. Assuming you have a goal, of course.|02-15-2014|pisces
589|The Sun in Aquarius in recent weeks has done wonders for your confidence and that’s great but now you are about to be tested. Important people are watching you closely, so put on a show. You are destined for bigger and better things.|02-17-2014|pisces
590|Carry a notepad with you at all times and be ready to write down any ideas that come into your mind. Your brain is always on the go but over the next few days you will be inspired, especially where career insights are concerned.|02-18-2014|pisces
591|It will pay you to keep a low profile and wait for the effects of today’s Mercury-Saturn alignment to pass. That applies to all areas of your life, but especially to your work situation. Don’t be the tall poppy that gets noticed! |02-19-2014|pisces
592|You will come under pressure today, especially on the work front where someone in a position of authority will do their best to make life miserable for you. Stay cool and don’t let them provoke you. Deep down they are scared of you.|02-20-2014|pisces
593|Disruptions are likely across the board today but chances are you won’t be as inconvenienced as some people. The good news is that upheavals tend to create new opportunities, so keep your eyes and ears open and be ready to act fast.|02-21-2014|pisces
594|You like to speak your mind but try not to say anything that might be taken the wrong way by other people. You may not mean to be rude but you can sound rude sometimes when speaking your mind to more sensitive types.|02-22-2014|pisces
595|How tough are you? Tough enough to rise to any challenge? Let’s hope so because the next few days will confront you with the kind of tests that bring out the best in some people and turn others into gibbering wrecks. Good luck!|02-23-2014|pisces
596|If you want to get noticed and move up in the world it won’t be long before an opportunity to do just that comes along. While you’re waiting try getting your health and fitness routine in better shape. You’ll need to be strong.|02-24-2014|pisces
597|You are going to have to make a difficult choice and what you decide will affect your life for months, maybe years, to come. Only you can make this choice but it’s got to be one thing or the other. The worst choice is no choice at all.|02-25-2014|pisces
598|Everyone makes mistakes and everyone at some time or other wishes they could go back and undo what they have done. With that fact in mind don’t be too hard on yourself if you realize you could have done more or done better. You’re only human.|02-26-2014|pisces
599|You will be challenged over the next few days, of that there is no doubt, but there also no doubt that you will rise to the challenge and come through unscathed. Remember: rivals and competitors are more scared of you then you need be of them.|02-27-2014|pisces
600|If you have something to say, something you know isn’t going to please some people, then say it now. Don’t worry about or even think about the consequences – your job is to call it as you see it, and you see more clearly than most.|02-28-2014|pisces
601|Be yourself and allow the creative side of your nature to shine through. Your rivals may try to upset your plans but they will only succeed if you allow them to annoy or distract you. Success is yours if you want it enough.|03-01-2014|pisces
602|You may believe you are in tiptop shape but the planets warn this is not a good time to push yourself physically. If anything you should be focusing more on mental activities. Use your big brain to come up with money-making ideas.|03-02-2014|pisces
603|No matter what you turn your hand to over the next few days it will work out better than you expected, and seeing as you expect nothing but the best of yourself that means you are going to accomplish something very special indeed.|03-03-2014|pisces
604|The planets warn that if you come on too strong today someone you work or socialize with will be so intimidated that in future they will try to keep a distance between you, which is not what you want at all. Think before you speak.|03-04-2014|pisces
605|Venus, planet of emotional and material values, moves in your favor today, making it necessary to think about who and what means the most to you. You know the answer already, of course, but it doesn’t hurt to remind yourself.|03-05-2014|pisces
606|Good news about your finances is on its way and by the end of the week you will be wondering why and how you allowed yourself to get so worked up about a simple thing like money. Treat yourself – you deserve it and you CAN afford it.|03-06-2014|pisces
607|You may be annoyed that a friend or family member failed to consult you before taking a course of action that affects you in some way, but don’t let it show. Frankly, there are more important things you should be focusing on right now.|03-07-2014|pisces
608|If you hesitate you could miss out on something good this weekend. An opportunity to improve yourself will arrive in a moment and be gone in a moment too, so stay alert and make sure that you are the one who benefits.|03-08-2014|pisces
609|This should be a relaxed and enjoyable week and it will be more enjoyable still if you share it with other people. Call on a friend or relative unexpectedly. Give them a surprise. Will it be a nice one? Of course – they always love seeing you!|03-09-2014|pisces
610|The challenges keep on coming, and you keep on dealing with them in your own special way. There are few things that faze you and whatever life chooses to throw at you over the next seven days you will handle it all with ease.|03-10-2014|pisces
611|This is a good time for creative activities, especially those where some sort of communication is concerned. Make sure you spell out what you are trying to say in words that are simple to understand. Not everyone possesses your brain power|03-11-2014|pisces
612|Fight for your rights today, no matter how overwhelming the odds may be. Actually the odds are not nearly stacked against you to the extent you appear to believe. Remember, too, that your rivals are as scared of you as you are of them.|03-12-2014|pisces
613|Relax and enjoy what the day brings your way. No matter how go-getting and ambitious a Gemini you may be there are times when even you must slow down and take time to smell the flowers along the way. Like right now.|03-13-2014|pisces
614|Your mind may be full of ideas but for best results you need to focus on the two or three things that will be of most benefit to you. No matter how many ideas you have your energy is limited, so invest it where it does most good.|03-14-2014|pisces
615|Push ahead with your plans this weekend and let employers and other important people know that you are serious about moving up in the world. A rival may try to persuade you that you are aiming too high but you must not believe them.|03-15-2014|pisces
616|With a full moon cutting across one of the more active angles of your chart there could be power struggles, especially at work. Try to get rid of the idea that everyone has got it in for you. It’s not true – it’s just one or two people.|03-16-2014|pisces
617|If you get the chance to move up on the work front you must take it. Don’t worry that you are not qualified for the job because energy and enthusiasm are more important than experience – and that’s something you’ll gain as you go along.|03-17-2014|pisces
618|If you get the chance to travel today, even if it is just a few miles down the road, you must take it. Venus and Uranus combine in such a favourable way that the more you are on the move the more fun you will have.|03-18-2014|pisces
619|No one dreams bigger than Gemini and if you play your cards right over the next few days there is every chance that some of those dreams will start to come true. The dividing line between fantasy and reality is quite narrow. Step over it.|03-19-2014|pisces
620|There are so many positive influences for friendship at the moment that you would be a fool not to take advantage – and a fool you most certainly are not! If you need assistance in any way just open your mouth. Help is always available.|03-20-2014|pisces
621|Try not to let your annoyance show if a friend gets something wrong today. Resist the urge to criticize and instead offer them words of advice in a warm and supportive way. Chances are they’ll get it right the next time.|03-21-2014|pisces
622|Mercury, your ruler, links with Neptune in the career area of your chart this weekend, which suggests you will be looking for a new start on the work front. Focus only on jobs you believe can really make a difference. Do something worthwhile.|03-22-2014|pisces
623|Mercury, your ruler, links with luck planet Jupiter this week, so it’s quite possible that you will come into money. But it’s equally possible that you will squander what you gain on impulse buys you don’t really need. Easy come, easy go.|03-23-2014|pisces
624|Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that influences friendships and group activities means you must not stay at home. Get out and meet people – real people, not just the ones you see on television. They certainly want to meet you.|03-24-2014|pisces
625|Mars in Libra makes all things possible but for best results you must be selective. Don’t waste your time and energy on a dozen aims because that will dilute your chances of success. What is the one thing that motivates you most? Do only that.|03-25-2014|pisces
626|You can sometimes be a bit too blunt for your own good and with Mercury, your ruler, linked to Jupiter, planet of excess, today you may very well say too much. But so what? At least, unlike some people, you have something worth saying.|03-26-2014|pisces
627|If you can get someone else to do some of your chores for you today then go for it. You have more important matters to take care of and, having burned the candle at both ends of late, you may not have much energy to spare.|03-27-2014|pisces
628|Money matters and career issues are under good influences today, so be brave and make the first move if you feel there is cash to be made or a promotion to be won. Success will be yours if you have the courage to reach out and take it.|03-28-2014|pisces
629||03-29-2014|pisces
630|A task may be a lot tougher than you expected but that is not a good enough excuse to give up on it. Everything that is meant to happen will happen when the time is right, so be patient. That breakthrough you need is not so far away. |03-30-2014|pisces
631|Think with your head, not with your heart. The most important thing as the new week begins is that you avoid making the kind of silly mistakes that so many other people make. Be rational and always put practical considerations first.|03-31-2014|pisces
632|Something you have been worrying about for quite a while will fade in significance today and that’s good. But has the cause of the worry actually gone or has it merely faded into the background? You need to find out.|04-01-2014|pisces
633|Just because you do not get along with someone on a personal level does not mean you cannot work with them. Put your feelings to one side and make an all-out effort to get a joint project finished. You may be surprised how smoothly it goes.|04-02-2014|pisces
634|Call it as you see it today and don’t worry what the reaction might be. Not everyone will be pleased that you are so open about the issues and so free with your opinions but that’s their fault for backing ideas that are so easily disproved.|04-03-2014|pisces
635|You have taken on a lot of new responsibilities of late but is that wise? You may think you can handle the extra work with ease but the planets warn it will sooner or later get too much for you. It should be about quality work, not quantity.|04-04-2014|pisces
636|You must let certain people know that whatever bad blood there may have been between you in the past it is over and done with as far as you are concerned. Make the first move – on this occasion it will be well worth the effort.|04-05-2014|pisces
637|Some of the people you will have to deal with this week are, to say the least, disconnected from reality. You may have to remind them all over again what is right and what is wrong and why certain things are just not done.|04-06-2014|pisces
638|Don’t worry too much about your work and worry even less about your money situation – focus entirely on friendships and having fun. Mercury, your ruler, moves in your favor today and that means you should be on the move as well.|04-07-2014|pisces
639|Don’t cling to ideas that are well past their sell-by date. They may seem comfortable to you now but later on they will hold you back from experiencing all the new things that life has to offer. Time never stands still, and nor should you.|04-08-2014|pisces
640|Some people may be quite loud in their opposition to what you intend to do but don’t let it worry you and don’t let it stop you. They will come round when they see how well you are doing. They may even claim it was their idea.|04-09-2014|pisces
641|It might be a good idea to tone down your comments a bit because the planets warn if you say something others consider to be over the top it will rebound on you in ways you had not expected. You can say too much you know.|04-10-2014|pisces
642|Someone you have always thought of as a rival will surprise you today by being not just friendly but also open and honest on a personal level. Is it a trick? No it is not – they genuinely like you and want you to like them.|04-11-2014|pisces
643|The planets warn there may be a tendency to see the negative side of events over the next 48 hours but now that you know that you can resolve to be happy no matter what happens. Attitude is everything. Always look on the bright side.|04-12-2014|pisces
644|Have the confidence to try things you have no way of knowing will turn out for the best. This is one of those occasions when logic won’t help you much, so follow your instincts and trust they will lead you somewhere worth going.|04-13-2014|pisces
645|Be careful with your cash because wealth planet Pluto begins one of its retrograde phases today. What does that mean in plain language? It means you could easily make a costly mistake. There’s no such thing as an easy dollar.|04-14-2014|pisces
646|The planets warn you must not pretend that certain things are true when they clearly are not – it could be a costly mistake. If you must take a risk at least wait until the effects of the current eclipse wane towards the end of the week.|04-15-2014|pisces
647|The only way you are going to move forward with a project is if you get the backing of people who can help you overcome the obstacles you are going to face. Give it another day or two before you approach them – then they’ll say “yes”.|04-16-2014|pisces
648|You have no time for people who think and act slowly – which, compared to you, is just about everyone – but the planets warn you need to be a bit more lenient and forgiving today. Not everyone can operate at your superstar level.|04-17-2014|pisces
649|You may be ambitious but ambition alone is not enough – you need to make sure that the career path you choose is worthy of your time and your energy. If you are not yet sure what it is you may get a few clues today.|04-18-2014|pisces
650|Keep things in perspective over the next 48 hours and don’t let anything upset your equilibrium. The Sun’s entry into the most sensitive area of your chart tomorrow makes this a time for quiet reflection – but don’t get hung up on the past.|04-19-2014|pisces
651|There is a danger that you will interpret information that comes your way in the worst possible light and believe that someone has got it in for you. Nothing could be further from the truth. Your only real enemy is your overactive imagination.|04-20-2014|pisces
652|The way you treat other people now will determine how other people treat you later on, so resist the urge to say or do anything that might turn them against you. Do whatever it takes to stay calm and stay on good terms.|04-21-2014|pisces
653|Misunderstandings are likely over the next 24 hours, so make sure you spell out what it is you are trying to accomplish and make sure everyone is on the same wavelength, because if they are not the results could be chaotic – and costly too.|04-22-2014|pisces
654|Your feelings may be a bit fragile over the next 24hours, so steer clear of situations that are challenging and stay away from people who are rude and insensitive. Some days it is necessary to restrict yourself to your own company.|04-23-2014|pisces
655|You don’t need anyone’s blessing or approval for what you are planning to do. All you need is the confidence to begin and the courage to follow through and finish the job. What are you waiting for? Now is always the best time to start.|04-24-2014|pisces
656|You will find it easy to get your own way – others will take it for granted that you are the boss and do as you say. If you use charm rather than coercion you will find that almost everyone will do almost anything for you.|04-25-2014|pisces
657|You know there is nothing to worry about but for some reason you still fear the worst. Don’t worry, the bottom is not about to fall out of your world. In fact, as from today your world will be a much happier place. Believe it – it’s true.|04-26-2014|pisces
658|The more you do for other people this coming week the more you do for yourself. Don’t worry about whether they deserve to be helped – that is not your concern – just do what you can, where you can and be satisfied with that.|04-27-2014|pisces
659|Mercury, your ruler, may be moving through the most shy and retiring area of your chart but if past experience is anything to go by that will merely encourage you to redouble your efforts to put on a show. You like to be noticed.|04-28-2014|pisces
660|You are paying far too much attention to what other people are saying and not enough to what your heart is telling you. You don’t need other people’s advice or assistance, you just need to turn your focus inward and follow your own inner voice.|04-29-2014|pisces
661|You may have to get tough with someone who has let you down or failed to carry out the tasks that were expected of them. Don’t go over the top and create unnecessary resentment but do make sure they realize this is the last warning they’ll get.|04-30-2014|pisces
662|If others want to make an issue of things that are of no significance to you then you have no choice but to turn your back and walk away. The last thing a big-brained thinker like you needs is small-minded people around you.|05-01-2014|pisces
663|The planets indicate that what you do for other people now will come back to you many times over a few weeks hence when the Sun moves in your favor again. You don’t have to sacrifice much – just put others’ needs first occasionally.|05-02-2014|pisces
664|You have a lot to do over the next 48 hours but you will find the energy from somewhere and impress just about everyone with your can-do attitude. You could be in the money too as past investments begin to pay off.|05-03-2014|pisces
665|The message of the stars for the coming week is that you should be putting your many talents to better use. Don’t listen to those who say your aims are misguided because only you know, deep down, what it is you should be doing.|05-04-2014|pisces
666|Creatively and romantically the next few days should be good for you, but for best results you need to be focused. Identify your number one priority and really go for it. Expect great things of yourself – you’ll achieve them with ease.|05-05-2014|pisces
667|You will be in one of your more impulsive moods today. Try not to spend money on things you don’t need unless you know you can afford it – and unless you have recently won the lottery you know full well you cannot.|05-06-2014|pisces
668|Start believing that you have what it takes to make a difference. Now that Mercury, your ruler, is moving into your sign the doubts of the past few weeks will be swept away. You will get your chance to shine, and in a good way.|05-07-2014|pisces
669|If you don’t feel like socializing today then don’t force yourself. You are entitled to your own space and if others find that hard to understand then they are not very smart. Give yourself some time to meditate on and plan for the future.|05-08-2014|pisces
670|You know there is a flaw in your plans but you are tempted to ignore it. Mistake. If you push ahead regardless you are sure to regret it. Work out where it is you have gone wrong, then make the necessary moves to put it right.|05-09-2014|pisces
671|You will want to be on your own for a bit this weekend but anyone who thinks that means you are giving up on some sort of struggle obviously doesn’t know you too well. Use your time to plan and plot your next big adventure.|05-10-2014|pisces
672|Set yourself easy goals this week, goals you can reach without too much of an effort. Better still, use your charm to get other people to do the hard stuff for you. On the work front especially you must not push yourself too hard.|05-11-2014|pisces
673|With Mercury, your ruler, linked to ambitious Mars as the new week begins there is no reason why you should not reach the top of the tree in your chosen career. Yes, you do have what it takes – more so than your rivals. Go for it.|05-12-2014|pisces
674|Everyone has fantasies and daydreams – you are nothing out of the ordinary in that sense – but the power of your imaginings could lead you in some unusual directions. Try to keep a grip on reality today, otherwise your mind could float away!|05-13-2014|pisces
675|It might be wise to slow down a bit, especially if you have been pushing both your mind and your body to extremes. Cosmic activity in the well-being area of your chart warns if you push any harder you could face collapse.|05-14-2014|pisces
676|You won’t be short of friends today, tomorrow and over the weekend as Mercury, your ruler, links with Venus, planet of harmony. What you do with others will be more enjoyable than what you do by yourself. The more the merrier!|05-15-2014|pisces
677|Your confidence is high at the moment and it will get even higher when the Sun enters your sign on the 21st. Before then make sure you have tied up all loose ends and make sure your plans are solid. You can’t be too careful.|05-16-2014|pisces
678|You need to decide, once and for all, what it is you want out of life – after that, of course, you need to work out how you are going to get it. Don’t let yesterday’s doubts and fears hold you back. Make each day a new beginning.|05-17-2014|pisces
679|The Sun moves into your birth sign on Wednesday and a new solar year gets under way. The more you feel you have been held back the more you will accomplish over the next few weeks. It’s time to move up a gear.|05-18-2014|pisces
680|The more others try to persuade you to get involved in a project of some sort the more you should make your excuses and back away. Today’s Mercury-Saturn link is guaranteed to mislead some people – but you don’t have to be one of them.|05-19-2014|pisces
681|You may have to postpone something you were looking forward to today, but come the end of the week you will look back and be glad you were forced to change the timing. Listen to what your inner voice is trying to tell you.|05-20-2014|pisces
682|Everything is right with the world. Or, if it isn’t, it soon will be. The Sun moves into your sign today and a new solar year begins. What are your dreams? What are your plans? Now is the time to get serious about them. Reach for the stars!|05-21-2014|pisces
683|Decide what it is you most want to accomplish over the next 12 months, then work out what you will have to do to make it happen. There will, of course, be a price to pay but the good things in life seldom come cheap. Identify your goal and go for it.|05-22-2014|pisces
684|What you most need to realize on your birthday is that it’s never too late to change direction or even to start again. If things are not working out the way you want them to then be bold in the changes you make. Remember: this is not a rehearsal, this is the real thing.|05-23-2014|pisces
685|Lady Luck may not have been on your side too often in recent weeks but that’s okay. Now that the Sun is moving through your sign you will make up for all the heartaches and missed opportunities. It’s good to see you smiling again!|05-24-2014|pisces
686|What other people are doing or saying is of no importance to you. Your needs and desires are unique and you have every right to pursue them in whatever ways you feel is most appropriate to you. The future is an open book. Start writing a new chapter today.|05-25-2014|pisces
687|For quite some time now you have been doing too many things for too many people and hardly anything for yourself. That must change. Start putting your own needs first this week – and recognize that your desires are important too.|05-26-2014|pisces
688|Follow your dream wherever it may take you over the coming 12 months and always believe you have a right to be happy. Some people may urge caution but you must not listen to them. Life is supposed to be an adventure, so be brave and take chances.|05-27-2014|pisces
689|A new moon on your birthday means the year ahead will be extra special. However, as Neptune, planet of illusion, is strong as well you must make sure your aims are well defined. Identify your number one ambition and stick with it through to completion.|05-28-2014|pisces
690|You may be a bit touchy over the next 24 hours. With your ruler Mercury moving into sensitive Cancer if there is anything worrying you it is sure to show up. Don’t try to avoid it – in fact you must confront it. It’s really no big deal.|05-29-2014|pisces
691|The tempo of life has picked up a lot of late and it will pick up even more today and over the weekend. Can you stand the pace? Of course you can: you’re a Gemini and you think and act twice as fast as most other people.|05-30-2014|pisces
692|You can, if you wish, force others to do your bidding this weekend but what is the point when they would quite willingly do what you ask of them anyway? All you have to do is ask nicely – you certainly don’t need to be aggressive.|05-31-2014|pisces
693|Don’t give too much away this week. Keep your plans to yourself, or at least keep them vague. The more others know about what you are planning the more likely it is they will oppose you. Secrecy can be made to work in your favor.|06-01-2014|pisces
694|There will be times this year when it seems as if you are the only sane person left in the world – and maybe you are. There is no point trying to change them – your one and only task is to use your insight and intelligence to improve your own conditions.|06-02-2014|pisces
695|Don’t make too many plans today because most likely they will have to be changed later on. Just go with the flow and trust that the tide of events will wash you up some place that is to your liking. Always be flexible.|06-03-2014|pisces
696||06-04-2014|pisces
697|Some sort of challenge will confront you today but you will overcome it with ease. Take action quickly and decisively and don’t doubt for a moment that you will succeed – good things are coming your way, maybe sooner than you expect.|06-05-2014|pisces
698|Today’s Sun-Uranus link will give you some remarkable ideas and insights but it is what you do with them that matters. Dreams are fun, and necessary too, but are they the sort of dreams that can be turned into realities? Think about it.|06-06-2014|pisces
699|You will have plenty to say for yourself over the coming year but because Mercury turns retrograde on your birthday you must make sure your opinions are backed up by facts. If you can do that then your words will have a hugely beneficial impact.|06-07-2014|pisces
700|Saturn, planet of limitation, is strong on your birthday this year, which means you need to get realistic about what is and is not possible, both in your personal life and in your career. Decide on your number one goal and move towards it a step at a time.|06-08-2014|pisces
701|No matter how big your workload may be you are advised to take it easy today. According to the planets you will be too impatient to do the best job you can do, so better to avoid certain tasks than make a mess of them.|06-09-2014|pisces
702|The more work you were hoping to do today the more the cosmos will conspire to hold you back and limit what you achieve. Now that you know that you can stop flogging yourself half to death and take the breather you need.|06-10-2014|pisces
703|You could make an issue of something that annoys you but is it worth the effort? There are so many things going right for you now that you can afford to let minor annoyances pass you by. If it doesn’t make you smile, give it a miss.|06-11-2014|pisces
704|Jupiter in the main financial area of your chart suggests you could come into money today – but it also warns you could lose it as quickly as it arrives. Don’t let rivals play on your greed – it’s very much your weak spot right now.|06-12-2014|pisces
705|You must not let others dictate to you in any way, shape or form, because once they get the idea that you can be ordered about they will make your life a misery. Make sure they know you can bite as well as you bark.|06-13-2014|pisces
706|You will start a lot of new things this weekend but there is a danger you may not finish any of them. It would be wiser, of course, to start fewer things and make a better job of them. Or is that too simple a solution for your tastes?|06-14-2014|pisces
707|The planets warn if you get impatient with someone who is moving too slowly for your liking it will only make matters worse. Make allowances for those who do not share your speed of thought or action – yes, that’s most people!|06-15-2014|pisces
708|The last few weeks have been enjoyable to say the least and there is no reason why the next few days should not be fun as well. However, with Mercury, your ruler, moving retrograde now some issues really do need to be taken seriously.|06-16-2014|pisces
709|Will this be a year of great achievement or will it be a year when you promise much but deliver little? The answer to that question depends on how well you define your goals. What is it you really want from life? Make that your one and only target.|06-17-2014|pisces
710|A year from now you will look back and be astounded at how far you have come – and how much fun you had along the way. Enjoy every good thing fate sends you and never doubt that you have earned them. It’s your destiny to be happy.|06-18-2014|pisces
711|You pride yourself on being supremely rational but with Mercury, your ruler, moving retrograde at the moment not every thought you have will be based entirely on reason. Don’t be too stubborn – there are times when it’s okay to change your mind.|06-19-2014|pisces
712|The Sun is about to leave your birth sign and it won’t be long before you notice a difference in the direction your life seems to be taking. The important thing is that you don’t try to stop the inevitable. Swim with the current, not against it.|06-20-2014|pisces
713|Life has been good to you of late but you know what they say: all good things must come to an end. The Sun leaves your sign today but the positive news is there is still a large luck factor working in your favor. Make use of it.|06-21-2014|pisces
714|You have a lot to do over the next few days and if others cannot keep up with your relentless pace that’s too bad. Do what you have to and don’t worry about those who fall behind. Look out for your own needs this week.|06-22-2014|pisces
715|This is potentially one of the best days of the year for you as Venus, planet of emotional and material values, moves into your birth sign. Good things will come at you from all directions – the only problem is it may be overwhelming.|06-23-2014|pisces
716|The next few days will be memorable – hopefully for the right reasons. You are more likely to enjoy yourself if you let go of hang-ups and allow yourself to enjoy what life has to offer. If you’re not smiling then you’re doing it wrong.|06-24-2014|pisces
717|You may be tempted to take what you want today, simply because you know that you can, but maybe you should look a little further ahead and think how it might affect a relationship. What goes around tends to come around eventually.|06-25-2014|pisces
718|You will get what you deserve today and tomorrow – no more and no less. If you have worked hard you will gain in ways that delight you, but if you have stayed within your comfort zone the rewards will be limited.|06-26-2014|pisces
719|What happens today will remind you that money is not the most important thing in the world. Yes, of course, you need to make a living but that does not mean you should put material things ahead of everything else. What about love?|06-27-2014|pisces
720|Make it your business to find out what is wrong with a partner or loved one, then make it your business to put it right. That may sound like a tall order but most likely it’s a problem that can quite easily be corrected.|06-28-2014|pisces
721|Be honest with yourself about what it is you desire and be ready to walk away if, as seems likely, the only way to get what you need is to cut your links with the past. Yesterday is over – it’s all about today and tomorrow.|06-29-2014|pisces
722|So many things will change over the next few days – and mostly they will be nice things. The planets are about to reward you for all the efforts you made but that is not an invitation to stop there. Keep the momentum going.|06-30-2014|pisces
723|What you say over the next 24 hours may come as a shock to some people but those who know you better will have seen it coming a long way off. You’ve held your tongue for too long – now it’s time to tell it like it is.|07-01-2014|pisces
724|You seem to be in a hugely positive mood now that Mercury, your ruler, is moving in your favor again. However, other aspects warn this is no time to rest on your laurels. There is still a lot more good you can do in the world.|07-02-2014|pisces
725|With Venus moving through your birth sign you seem to be more mellow than you usually are and that is surely a good thing. It’s also a necessary thing as something is about to happen that takes you completely by surprise.|07-03-2014|pisces
726|There will be times today when you could scream at people who refuse to see sense but if you are wise you will keep quiet. Your way of doing things may indeed be best but no amount of persuasion or threats will change their minds.|07-04-2014|pisces
727|You have to decide whether a partnership of some kind is worth carrying on with or whether it has come to the end of the road. You know what the answer is already but you may be reluctant to admit it to yourself. Be brave.|07-05-2014|pisces
728|The most important thing this coming week is that you identify your priorities. The second most important thing is that you stick with them. The more you chop and change the more likely it is you will achieve less than you expected.|07-06-2014|pisces
729|There are times when it is right to act on a hunch and this is one of them. With surprises planet Uranus strong in your chart you should not only listen to your inner voice but act on what it is so clearly telling you.|07-07-2014|pisces
730|It may be tempting to neglect certain responsibilities but it would also be a mistake. Others are watching you closely and if you cut corners or leave a job unfinished it won’t do your reputation a whole lot of good. Make an effort.|07-08-2014|pisces
731|Try not to be suspicious if someone offers you for free the one thing you really desire today. Yes, of course, it could be a trick, but it could also be a sign that they genuinely want to see you find happiness.|07-09-2014|pisces
732|Try not to come across as too assertive or aggressive. A lot will depend over the next few days on your ability to meet others halfway, especially in areas where there is money at stake. Win people over, don’t turn them against you.|07-10-2014|pisces
733|Something you have feared for a long time will make an unwelcome appearance over the next 24 hours but it’s actually very good news because this time you will have to deal with it. You’re more courageous than you think you are.|07-11-2014|pisces
734|Listen carefully to what others are saying today because you might get lucky and hear something that could make you some money. It is remarkable what you can pick up simply by being aware of what is taking place around you.|07-12-2014|pisces
735|Whatever you choose to do over the next few days life will be anything but dull. You’re a social animal by nature, so dress up and hit the town. Put serious matters out of your mind – for you it’s now party season.|07-13-2014|pisces
736|If you need to do something that is going to take a lot of physical energy then now is the time. Also, don’t wait to be offered something you are in a position to take for yourself. Be bold, be brave and be the first into action.|07-14-2014|pisces
737|Even if your current situation is not as good as you would like it to be it won’t be long before it improves, so don’t be so pessimistic. A week from now the Sun will move into one of the more positive areas of your chart.|07-15-2014|pisces
738|You will find it easier to put your point of view across as from today, which is nice. Even nicer is that you will discover that family and friends are on your side, which has not always been the case in recent weeks.|07-16-2014|pisces
739|You will get the chance to do things for friends and family members today but make sure they don’t take advantage of you. Also, being of service does not mean you can’t have fun as well. Treat yourself over the next 24 hours.|07-17-2014|pisces
740|Anything of a creative nature will go well for you today – and you could make some money from it too. Your number one aim is, of course, to enjoy what you are doing, but if it helps your finances too that’s a happy bonus.|07-18-2014|pisces
741|You need to take control of your current situation, rather than let other people decide what you will do and when you will do it. You were born to be a leader, not a follower, so get your act together and let everyone know you’re the boss.|07-19-2014|pisces
742|Something will happen over the next few days that proves you were right and your rivals were wrong. Will you gloat? Of course you will! Enjoy your moment of triumph. Treat yourself and your friends to a victory celebration – then move on.|07-20-2014|pisces
743|You have enough work on your plate as it is, so don’t take on any more. The planets warn if you go beyond your limits now you will regret it later in the week when you don’t have the energy to take advantage of new opportunities.|07-21-2014|pisces
744|You may want to be on the move but the planets indicate it will pay you to stay right where you are and get your thoughts and emotions in order. An exceptionally busy phase is about to begin, but you must be calm today.|07-22-2014|pisces
745|There is no point worrying about how you are going to make ends meet. You know from experience that something always comes up. In fact, you are one of those people who, no matter how far they fall, always seem to land on their feet.|07-23-2014|pisces
746|Use your mind more over the next 24 hours. Take on mental challenges that at other times might confuse or bemuse you. The more you make use of your brain power the more you will gain, not just intellectually but financially too.|07-24-2014|pisces
747|You have nothing to prove and everything to look forward to. That is the message of the stars today and even if you don’t quite believe it now you will over the weekend. The universe wants you to have fun – and you’re good at that!|07-25-2014|pisces
748|Don’t waste time arguing the toss with people whose views you do not respect. You know what is right and what is wrong and that’s all that matters – you certainly don’t have to try to persuade those who can’t see the truth.|07-26-2014|pisces
749|Keep your suspicions to yourself, not because they are wrong but because you should be looking for the best in people, not the worst. No one is perfect, not even you, so turn a blind eye to others’ failings over the next seven days.|07-27-2014|pisces
750|There is no point trying to make sense of what’s going on. The more you try to analyze the situation the more complicated it will look, so leave well alone and focus on things you feel comfortable with and can change without fuss.|07-28-2014|pisces
751|The closer you work with other people today the more likely it is you will share in something that brings great benefits to everyone, both personal and professional. Joint efforts will bring bigger rewards than if you had worked on your own.|07-29-2014|pisces
752|One huge effort may get you past some kind of obstacle but will it have an adverse effect on your health? The planets urge you to take a more relaxed attitude to what you think you have to do. Will it wait? Of course it will.|07-30-2014|pisces
753|Shove any worries you might have to the back of your mind and have fun today. The Sun in Leo at this time of year brings all sorts of social and travel opportunities your way and it would be criminal not to take advantage of them.|07-31-2014|pisces
754|With the Sun, Jupiter and now Mercury, your ruler, moving through one of the more positive areas of your chart you will find it easy to hit targets that in the past you assumed were too high for you. Reach for the sky!|08-01-2014|pisces
755|This is an excellent time for travel and social activities and with Mercury, your ruler, on good terms with larger-than-life Jupiter this weekend life will be one big party. You could also meet someone you fall head over heels for.|08-02-2014|pisces
756|Do something special over the next few days, something that gets you noticed and marks you out not just as a thinker but as a doer as well. Don’t sit back waiting for opportunities to come to you – go out and create them for yourself.|08-03-2014|pisces
757|By all means give others a chance to put their points of view across today but once they have done so you must come down strongly in favor of your own opinion. Don’t beat about the bush: say your piece and have done with it.|08-04-2014|pisces
758|If you look for the best you will surely find it, but if you look for the worst you will find that too. Everything, and everyone, has a light side and a dark side. Make it your aim to encourage the light side today.|08-05-2014|pisces
759|There will be times today when it seems that for every step forward you take you end up taking two steps backwards. It may be frustrating but there is nothing much you can do about it, so go with the flow and don’t get uptight.|08-06-2014|pisces
760|Whatever you turn your hand to today it will work out better than you expected. One of your strengths is that you are always willing to give something a go – especially when the doubters tell you it cannot be done. Have fun proving them wrong.|08-07-2014|pisces
761|Today’s Sun-Mercury link will do wonders for your confidence and also your popularity. Just remember that it’s not possible to accept each and every invitation, social or professional, that comes your way. There’s only so much of you to go around!|08-08-2014|pisces
762|You get a kick out of being different and will happily upset those you consider to be too conservative in their thinking. But when you dish it out you have to be ready to take it as well. You won’t get it all your own way.|08-09-2014|pisces
763|Sometimes you can be too nice for your own good but this week you will go right the other way and hit back at whoever is giving you a hard time. You are under no obligation to be nice to people who are not nice to you.|08-10-2014|pisces
764|If you give in to your emotions and start shouting back at people who raise their voices for no good reason today you will be the loser. Calm yourself. There is nothing to be gained by getting worked up about trivial issues.|08-11-2014|pisces
765|Don’t worry if you have not yet made a serious start on a project that means a lot to you because you will get your chance over the next two or three days. Think before you act – and keep your emotions out of it.|08-12-2014|pisces
766|The planets will help you make the break you have been dreaming of but it won’t happen as if by magic – the effort must come from you. If you don’t make that move now, or at least by the end of the week, when will you make it?|08-13-2014|pisces
767|Cosmic activity in the work area of your chart makes this a good time to get started on things of a practical nature. Set yourself targets but make sure they are ones you can reach. There is no point putting yourself under pressure.|08-14-2014|pisces
768|You may not agree with what a friend or loved one tells you they have been up to but resist the urge to say outright that it is wrong. It may not be what you would do in the same situation but different people have different values.|08-15-2014|pisces
769|You will get advice from all directions today but the only advice you need will come from that small voice inside you. Not only does it know the right answers but it knows the right questions too, which is far more important.|08-16-2014|pisces
770|You need to take a more practical view of your family or your financial situation, because only when you know what the problem is can you start to do something about it. Enjoy your dreams but don’t lose sight of reality.|08-17-2014|pisces
771|Love planet Venus urges you to let that special someone know they are the best thing that ever happened to you. Don’t keep your feelings locked up inside – speak up now and the romantic glow will last until the end of the year.|08-18-2014|pisces
772|Some people love making a drama out of things that are not even remotely a crisis. There is no point trying to persuade them there is nothing to worry about because they will not be convinced. All you can do is to keep your distance.|08-19-2014|pisces
773|You can usually be counted on to act rationally, but the planets will make that more difficult than usual over the next 24 hours. If you find yourself getting emotional for no good reason remind yourself of all the things you have to be thankful for.|08-20-2014|pisces
774|Duties and chores will take up a large slice of your time today, time you would no doubt prefer to spend socializing. Do what has to be done and do it well – then you won’t have to go back and do it again later.|08-21-2014|pisces
775|A money matter you thought has been resolved will be up in the air again over the next few days and the good news is if you move fast you can be the one who benefits the most. You need some extra cash.|08-22-2014|pisces
776|You must assert your authority over the next 48 hours. The planets will in some way or other put you on the spot and others will be watching closely how you deal with the situation. Be tough. Let them know you won’t be intimidated.|08-23-2014|pisces
777|Monday’s new moon will bring new opportunities but they will be the kind of opportunities that you need help with to make the most of. Get your nearest and dearest involved – you’ve been drifting a bit too far apart of late.|08-24-2014|pisces
778|Don’t keep your feelings bottled up inside you. Let them out so they can be dealt with. Gemini may be one of the zodiac’s more rational signs but you have an irrational side too. It’s okay to shout and scream a bit occasionally.|08-26-2014|pisces
779|The challenges you face over the next few days will be of a minor nature, so try not to get worked up about them. Also, don’t take it personally if someone says something less than flattering about you. It’s just their opinion.|08-27-2014|pisces
780|A difference of opinion may be annoying but in the greater scheme of things it is of no real importance, so don’t go to war over it. You should be confident enough in your own beliefs that you don’t need other people’s approval.|08-28-2014|pisces
781|If you sit quietly and let your inner voice speak to you today you will get the answers you have been looking for. Never doubt there is meaning to your existence – and never stop trying to find out what it is.|08-29-2014|pisces
782|Like it or not there are duties and responsibilities you cannot avoid and the sooner you get on with them the sooner you will be able to move on to more interesting activities. Also, make sure you do a good job – it’s quality that counts.|08-30-2014|pisces
783|You need to deal with a situation that really should have been sorted a long time ago. Fortunately, with Mercury, your ruler, moving in your favor over the next few days you will see what needs to be done and get on with it immediately.|08-31-2014|pisces
784|The planets are giving you a massive boost of confidence and all you have to do to succeed is focus on your number one goal. Anyone who comes between you and what you are after will wish they had stayed out of your way.|09-01-2014|pisces
785|You may be independent by nature but even a Gemini needs help sometimes and you will need it over the next 24 hours. With Mercury, moving into the most sociable area of your chart speak up and you’ll get all the assistance you require.|09-02-2014|pisces
786|Make sure you know all the facts before getting involved in a feud of some sort. You may want to help and bring people back together, but if you are unaware of what is really going on you may end up making the situation even worse.|09-03-2014|pisces
787|Sacrifices of one kind or another will have to be made over the next few weeks but they are worth it. The important thing is that you stay calm and don’t do anything drastic such as borrowing money from one person to pay back another.|09-04-2014|pisces
788|Venus, planet of values, urges you to be a bit more understanding of someone who has let you down in some way. Almost certainly they didn’t mean to. Almost certainly it was an accident. There is no reason at all to be bitter.|09-05-2014|pisces
789|Your arguments may sound convincing to you but it would appear other people are not convinced and that could cause problems this weekend. Try to remember that everyone is different and everyone has their own way of interpreting the facts.|09-06-2014|pisces
790|Life may be good to you at the moment but a partner or loved one is having a tough time of things. Take time out from what you are doing and offer a consoling word or helping hand. Your kindness will be appreciated.|09-07-2014|pisces
791|You have friends in high places and you must make better use of them. There is no valid reason why you should miss out on the good things simply because you think it is wrong to give yourself an advantage over your rivals.|09-08-2014|pisces
792|Actions speak louder than words, so if you have fallen out with a friend or colleague do whatever it take to get past the situation. You don’t want the dispute to drag on indefinitely, and neither do they, so work something out.|09-09-2014|pisces
793|Neptune can be a disruptive influence and because it is now at odds with love planet Venus it could have a negative effect on affairs of the heart. Promises made in the heat of the night are easily broken in the cold light of day.|09-10-2014|pisces
794|Your physical and emotional reserves are likely to be a bit depleted at the moment, so take it easy today and tomorrow. There are a number of ways you can improve your health and streamline your working routine without being silly about it.|09-11-2014|pisces
795|The cosmic picture will be changing over the next few days and with Mars moving into your opposite sign you may find that minor problems loom a lot larger than before. Don’t worry – you’ll find ways to deal with them.|09-12-2014|pisces
796|A personal relationship will come under strain this weekend and your commitment will certainly be tested. Whatever the challenge you must face it together and, hopefully, triumph together. The bond between you will be stronger than ever.|09-13-2014|pisces
797|However much you care for a certain individual you know better than to involve yourself too deeply in their personal affairs. If you get the chance to offer some appropriate advice today that’s okay but don’t force your opinions on them. |09-14-2014|pisces
798|You may have to devote the daylight hours to work-related matters but once the Sun goes down your thoughts will be on having fun. As far as romance is concerned a secret crush you have is unlikely to stay secret much longer.|09-15-2014|pisces
799|If you have a favor to ask of a friend or family member, now is the time. The planets indicate that for reasons which may not be entirely clear everyone wants to help you today. You would be foolish not to take advantage of it.|09-16-2014|pisces
800|Not everything will go the way you want it to go today but those things which do work out right will far outnumber those things which don’t. A domestic or romantic dispute can now easily be resolved – IF you are willing to say sorry first.|09-17-2014|pisces
801|If you get the chance to improve your cashflow situation you must take it. Your ability to think on your feet and to make quick and correct decisions means you will be much in demand today. Be sure to make it pay.|09-18-2014|pisces
802|Your priority now must be to get out into the world and do what Geminis do best – have fun Career and money worries can be left until another day, or another week, or another month. Okay, go the whole hog – leave them for another year.|09-19-2014|pisces
803|You enjoy the limelight and you will certainly get the chance to put on a show over the next 48 hours. It’s good that you like being the center of attention because it will happen often over the next four or five weeks.|09-20-2014|pisces
804|If you feel restless and ill at ease don’t sweat it – you will get the chance to ring the changes when the Sun moves in your favor this coming Tuesday. What you have to leave behind will be eclipsed by what awaits you in a new environment.|09-21-2014|pisces
805|Don’t worry about money or career problems because the Sun’s change of signs tomorrow means you will soon have more enjoyable issues to focus on. Problems will remain, of course, but your attitude towards them will be much more positive.|09-22-2014|pisces
806|According to the planets you are overreacting to what is really a quite minor event, but the good news is that with the Sun now moving into the most positive area of your chart you will soon get over it. Make having fun your mission.|09-23-2014|pisces
807|You will get a clear picture in your mind’s eye today of what it is you want out of life and what you will have to do to get it. After that it’s up to you – do you have the ambition and staying power to make it happen?|09-24-2014|pisces
808|You will tackle even the most difficult tasks with ease today. A wonderful aspect between the heavyweight planets Jupiter and Uranus means you are in tune with the spirit of the times, so sing along and find fun in everything you do.|09-25-2014|pisces
809|The setbacks and disappointments of recent months can now be seen in a much more positive light. Even when you were on the receiving end of bad news it was teaching you and toughening you up – and now you will thrive.|09-26-2014|pisces
810|No doubt you know where you are going and no doubt you know what needs to be done to get from here to there but don’t close your ears to other people’s advice. A friend’s or loved one’s experiences could be invaluable.|09-27-2014|pisces
811|You are on course to accomplish something remarkable, even more so if you have a clear idea of the target you are aiming for. A burst of activity over the next few days will produce the kind of results it usually takes months to put together.|09-28-2014|pisces
812|A completely unexpected event will throw you off your stride today but that’s okay. You will still be heading in roughly the right direction and if you get there a bit later and by a roundabout route it’s no big deal.|09-29-2014|pisces
813|Don’t stay silent today just because you worry you might upset someone who has the power to make life difficult for you. Chances are they respect your opinions more than you realize and will respect them even more if you make your point honestly.|09-30-2014|pisces
814|Something you take for granted will be changed beyond recognition over the next few days. But seeing as it is so clearly a change for the better you won’t be in the least bit worried. In fact you may wish it had happened sooner.|10-01-2014|pisces
815|You can afford to take a few risks today where affairs of the heart are concerned. Don’t be afraid to reveal your innermost feelings to the one whose affections you are after – they will most likely respond in similar fashion.|10-02-2014|pisces
816|What exactly is it that you most desire? Vague feelings won’t do – you need to be as specific as you can if you are to have any real hope of making your dream come true. Imagine it, desire it, embrace it, then own it!|10-03-2014|pisces
817|This is potentially one of the best times of the year for you on just about every level, so don’t sit at home all weekend – get out there and show the world what you are about. Star quality is rare, but you’ve got tons of it.|10-04-2014|pisces
818|Certain people may say you are under an obligation to get involved in their problems and their causes but you’re not. It is entirely up to you what you do and don’t do and what you support and don’t support. Don’t let them intimidate you.|10-05-2014|pisces
819|Something may look simple on the surface but if you dig a little deeper over the next 24 hours you will find it is anything but. If you can, stand back a little and view what’s going on from a wider perspective. You’ll get the picture.|10-06-2014|pisces
820|Be firm and decisive and don’t let anyone tell you that you are not entitled to enjoy the good things in life. Too often in the past you have held back while those less talented but with bigger egos have pushed ahead. Time to reverse that.|10-07-2014|pisces
821|Something extraordinary is about to happen in your life – you just know it. Today’s eclipse will sweep away obstacles and enable you to turn what has until now been merely a dream into a real-life achievement. Show the world you mean business.|10-08-2014|pisces
822|Your approach to a certain situation may be ridiculed by those who think you are doomed to failure but they won’t be laughing when they see you make a success of it. Never be afraid to go your own way and do your own thing.|10-09-2014|pisces
823|According to the planets you are in danger of making a simple situation more complicated than it needs to be. Relax, take your time and let your inner voice guide you. It knows the way and all you have to do is follow.|10-10-2014|pisces
824|Expect some surprises where your ideals, beliefs and friendships are concerned this weekend. Or maybe the opposite will happen and what you thought would be a surprise turns out to be entirely predictable. With Uranus involved, you just can’t tell.|10-11-2014|pisces
825|Things will work out well for you over the next few days, even though you may be convinced that Lady Luck has deserted you. Get rid of that pessimistic attitude and believe that you are the luckiest person alive – because you are! |10-12-2014|pisces
826|What you most need to ask yourself today is this: is the cause I am fighting for really worth the effort? Maybe you are already beginning to suspect that the answer is “no”. In which case you need to start backing away from it.|10-13-2014|pisces
827|Your enthusiasm for a project will reach new heights today but don’t just throw yourself at it in one mad rush. A little bit of planning now will lead to huge benefits later in the year, so put in the brain work first.|10-14-2014|pisces
828|The task you have set yourself may seem a bit scary but if you have confidence in yourself and if you act as if you cannot lose it will be a great success. What seems most difficult for you now is in fact extremely easy.|10-15-2014|pisces
829|Life is good and getting better by the moment, so why are you so fearful? No doubt it has something to do with Mercury, your ruler, in one of its retrograde phases. Don’t worry. No matter what happens in the short-term, the long-term outlook is rosy.|10-16-2014|pisces
830|Don’t push yourself too hard physically or worry that you are not giving enough mentally or emotionally. Even a Gemini needs to slow down a bit once in a while and with your ruler Mercury still moving retrograde this is the ideal time.|10-17-2014|pisces
831|Try not to overreact to minor problems over the next few days or they could develop into major issues for no good reason. You would rather deal with a genuine crisis than a petty dispute and the Sun’s change of signs on Thursday could make it happen.|10-19-2014|pisces
832|You may have to cut back on your commitments in order to save time and money but don’t overdo it. Jupiter, planet of excess, is strong in your chart today, so there is a danger you could go too far. Avoid all kinds of extremes.|10-20-2014|pisces
833|Take something that seems ordinary and turn it into something special over the next 24 hours. You cannot escape your commitments but you can make life easier for yourself by taking a more active interest in the passing events of everyday life.|10-21-2014|pisces
834|Any minor health worries you have must be dealt with over the next 48 hours. Most likely you have absolutely nothing to fear, physically at least, but it won’t hurt to get a professional opinion, if only to put your mind at ease.|10-22-2014|pisces
835|What you need to remember today is that every cause has an effect. The planets indicate that something is about to happen that is directly linked to what you said or did in the dim and distant past. What goes around comes around.|10-23-2014|pisces
836|Don’t brood about big things you cannot change. Instead, focus on small things you can do right now, at this very moment. No matter how mundane they may be if you keep at it your small steps will become giant strides.|10-24-2014|pisces
837|You don’t mind challenges, in fact you quite like them, but there are limits and the pressure you are currently under is becoming a burden to say the least. The fact is you have brought a lot of it on yourself. Find ways to slow down and relax.|10-25-2014|pisces
838|You can do many things but one thing you have never been much good at is reading minds. If someone requires your help today they must come right out and ask for it. Only when you know what they want can you give them what they need.|10-26-2014|pisces
839|Neptune’s negative influence is eroding your confidence and exposing you to fears and worries that really are not warranted. Fortunately, your current negative state of mind is unlikely to last. You’re just too fun-loving to be down for long.|10-27-2014|pisces
840|You may think you know all you need to know about a friend or colleague but over the next 24 hours you will find out things about them that you had not even guessed at. Seems they have hidden depths – just like you.|10-28-2014|pisces
841|It may sadden you that a friend or family member clearly feels unhappy with what you are doing but that’s just the way it is. The more you try to convince them it’s okay the more anti they are likely to get, so let it pass.|10-29-2014|pisces
842|The Sun in the work area of your chart means you have a number of duties and responsibilities to attend to and, although you might prefer to ignore them, you feel honor bound to do what is expected of you. You will be well rewarded.|10-30-2014|pisces
843|The road ahead of you may not look too inviting but once you are on the move you will find that the journey is not so bad. The fact is you can find something to enjoy in any direction you travel — it’s largely a state of mind.|11-02-2014|pisces
844|You may think you have energy to spare today but in reality your physical batteries are running low, so don’t take on any new responsibilities. Despite what some people might say you don’t have to burn the candle at both ends to succeed. |11-03-2014|pisces
845|There are two ways you can deal with a problem: the quick way that calms things down in the short-term but does not guarantee it won’t return; or the long way that takes more time and effort but is ultimately more effective. You know which is best.|11-04-2014|pisces
846|According to the planets you are working too hard and need to take a break. Everyone needs time to relax and enjoy the finer things in life and you need it more than most at the present moment. Work can wait – peace of mind cannot. |11-05-2014|pisces
847|A problem related to your work is not as difficult to solve as you imagine and the answer will be obvious once you ignore the usual solutions and try something different. Remember too that you don’t have to do it all yourself.|11-07-2014|pisces
848|Start thinking about ways you can make your working routine less stressful. You may not get the chance to put your ideas into effect immediately but by the middle part of next week you will be glad you made the effort.|11-08-2014|pisces
849|Knowing what you don’t want to do can be every bit as valuable as knowing what you do want to do, especially if it helps you make some kind of choice. Just be aware this week that you don’t have to make that choice immediately.|11-09-2014|pisces
850|You will start the week inspired mentally and overflowing with energy physically. If you can apply your talents in the right direction there is no limit to what you can achieve over the next four or five days. If you can think it you can do it too.|11-10-2014|pisces
851|You may be worried about taking a risk with your resources but what alternatives do you have? Not many. You of all people should know that if you stick to the same old routine you will keep on getting the same old results. |11-11-2014|pisces
852|You have something important to say and you should say it both loudly and immediately. The longer you allow something that annoys or upsets you to continue the worse it will get, so speak up and, if necessary, provoke a showdown. |11-12-2014|pisces
853|You enjoy a certain amount of drama in your life but you need stability too and today you will be delighted to discover there are people you can trust and turn to when the going gets tough. Ask for help and you will get it instantly.|11-13-2014|pisces
854|Try not to exaggerate your troubles today, because with the Sun at odds with Jupiter, planet of expansion, things could easily get out of control. Loved ones and work colleagues are in no mood to encourage feelings of self-pity.|11-14-2014|pisces
855|It may appear as if some people lead more glamorous lives than you but from their point of view you seem to be having fun as well. Don’t envy what others have got – simply make more of your own skills and talents.|11-15-2014|pisces
856|Friends and loved ones may think you have taken leave of your senses but you know that the course of action you are contemplating is right for you. A change of scene will do you the world of good – a change of outlook even more so.|11-16-2014|pisces
857|You may be tempted to bulldoze your way through obstacles today but is that really such a good idea? Why risk causing trouble when you can get what you need by less provocative methods? Might sometimes makes right, but not today.|11-18-2014|pisces
858|Stop being so suspicious and accept that what people say is what they mean. If a friend or work colleague has promised to do something for you then you must trust that they intend to deliver. Don’t keep going on about it.|11-19-2014|pisces
859|Ignore those who urge you to take a more “balanced” approach. If you want something enough you must go out and get it, regardless of whose toes you might be treading on. Don’t give an inch – in fact tread on those toes even harder.|11-20-2014|pisces
860|This may be a difficult time but you don’t have to let it get on top of you. On the work front it would appear that someone has got into the habit of expecting you to do all the work. Maybe it’s time to turn round and say “no”. |11-21-2014|pisces
861|An idea you have may seem impractical to some but you have total faith in your own abilities. You are not the sort to be put off just because something is new or untested – that’s what makes it exciting and worth the effort. |11-22-2014|pisces
862|If a friend suggests a course of action you are not too sure about, go along with it anyway. You always like to be in control of your own destiny but on this occasion you could do worse than put yourself in their capable hands.|11-23-2014|pisces
863|If others expect you to act in ways you do not enjoy then obviously something is wrong. You don’t have to do what they want you to do. You certainly do not have to play a role that feels alien to you. Be yourself. |11-24-2014|pisces
864|If nothing adds up it can only be because you are using the wrong measuring tool. Put your current beliefs and attitudes aside for a few hours and everything will soon be crystal clear. Your life actually makes perfect sense. |11-25-2014|pisces
865|If you can imagine something then you can do it as well. What you visualize over the next 24 hours is what you will be able to do in weeks to come, so don’t dismiss what are genuine insights as fantasy or wishful thinking.|11-26-2014|pisces
866|Is what you are doing with your life meaningful? Most likely it is but there may be moments today when your confidence wavers and doubts creep in. Try to understand that whatever path you are on it is the right one for you.|11-27-2014|pisces
867|When you want something enough you let nothing stand in your way, which is good. What is not so good is if you climb over other people to get it. Mercury in your opposite sign as from today encourages you to be more diplomatic.|11-28-2014|pisces
868|Be spontaneous, be original, be the one who stands out from the crowd. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Sagittarius means you won’t always get the level of support you would like but the fact is you really don’t need it.|11-29-2014|pisces
869|There are several things you can do to make sure the week ahead of you is relaxed and enjoyable. Clear up the backlog of jobs you started but never quite got round to completing on Monday and Tuesday. After that, you time is your own.|11-30-2014|pisces
870|Mars in the wealth area of your chart means you have important financial arrangements to deal with and you must do so from a position of strength. Know your own worth and don’t accept anything less. A top job deserves top dollar payment. |12-01-2014|pisces
871|You will need to be tough, maybe even ruthless, if you are to protect your interests against those who would like to see you fail. Emotional and material security is important to you but you will only get it if you fight for it.  |12-02-2014|pisces
872|Your present location may seem exactly right for you but when Mars changes signs tomorrow new options will present themselves and you will start to think about making a move. You rarely stay in one place for long.|12-03-2014|pisces
873|There will be all sorts of opportunities to improve yourself, personally and professionally, over the next few days but there will also be challenges that force you to make far-reaching changes. Take the rough with the smooth.|12-04-2014|pisces
874|The approaching full moon will affect you more than most because it takes place in your sign, and if you get through the next two or three days emotionally unscathed you can count yourself lucky! Try not to take anything too seriously.|12-05-2014|pisces
875|You will get the chance to settle a long-running emotional dispute this weekend and you must do so without hesitation. Even if you believe that you have nothing to apologize for it won’t do you any good to prolong the feud.|12-06-2014|pisces
876|You may regret not having more time enjoy your social life but there is a reason you are having to focus on more serious matters. Clear you mind of negative thoughts and you will see there is a positive pattern to recent events.|12-07-2014|pisces
877|Get out into the world and have a good time. The more people you meet on your travels the better as they will open your eyes to new possibilities. And if some people do not approve of your gallivanting? Do it even more! |12-08-2014|pisces
878|It may look as if you are the only one who knows what’s going on at the moment but the planets warn you could be kidding yourself. It might be wise not to trust everything your five senses tell you over the next 24 hours. |12-09-2014|pisces
879|Stick to the facts today, especially when dealing with money matters. If you are tempted to make a decision for sentimental reasons it could easily backfire on you, so be cautious and make sure your cash stays where it belongs – in your pocket.|12-10-2014|pisces
880|You will have to make sacrifices over the next few days but that’s okay. You will get your reward later in the month when the Sun moves in your favor again – and it will be worth the wait. Today, try to avoid conflicts at work.|12-11-2014|pisces
881|You may feel a little worn out after the excitement of the past few days but don’t switch off completely because there are still important things that need to be done. Use your Gemini way with words to get others to do the hard stuff for you. |12-12-2014|pisces
882|You will want to be on the move this weekend but friends and loved ones will want you to stay right where you are. Something will have to give and no way should it be you. If one place bores you just move to another.|12-13-2014|pisces
883|The planets urge you to knuckle down and create something of lasting value this week. Don’t worry if certain people make fun of your aims – most likely they are jealous of your talent and secretly fear you will succeed. They’re right, you will.|12-14-2014|pisces
884|You may be fired with enthusiasm for a new plan or project but not everyone is convinced. Does that matter? Only if you care about their opinions. Your best course of action is to just get on and do what feels right to you. |12-15-2014|pisces
885|Be careful you don’t bite off more than you can chew today, especially if you are trying to impress important people. The best way to influence them is to just be yourself. If you’ve got what it takes – and you have – they will notice. |12-16-2014|pisces
886|Someone will try to persuade you to part with some of your cash today and you must turn them down flat. Just because they’ve had a good idea does not mean you have to finance it, and certainly not without a binding contract.|12-17-2014|pisces
887|This is a time of major changes for you, especially on an inner level. Those changes will accelerate when the Sun moves into Capricorn at the weekend, so treat yourself gently and get plenty of rest. You will most likely need it! |12-18-2014|pisces
888|You will be torn between conflicting duties today and whichever one you choose to prioritize someone, somewhere is not going to like it. In which case it might be better to forget about everyone else and put your own needs first for a change.|12-19-2014|pisces
889|Be careful you don’t let slip information that could either be used against you or used to make money at your expense. You may be outgoing and chatty by nature but there are times when even a Gemini should keep quiet. |12-20-2014|pisces
890|Be on your guard this week because the planets warn that someone you do business with may try to cheat you. On the other hand they also warn that you could overreact, so make sure you are certain of the facts before making accusations.|12-21-2014|pisces
891|Keep your wits about you today or you could lose out financially. Someone you think is a friend is actually a secret rival, so don’t take anything for granted and don’t accept what they tell you without checking it out for yourself. |12-22-2014|pisces
892||12-23-2014|pisces
893|There will be some remarkable developments in the final few days of the year, which is great, but you would be wise to conserve your energy today and tomorrow. The less you do now the more you will gain later on. |12-24-2014|pisces
894|If your inner voice urges you to take a risk then that is exactly what you should do, even if everyone else tells you not to be foolish. Maybe they’re right, maybe you are taking unnecessary chances, but your instincts are too strong to resist. |12-25-2014|pisces
895|Keep personal information to yourself today. You may be tempted to bare your soul and let a certain person now what you have been going through but the planets warn that is not a good idea. If one knows then soon everyone will know. |12-26-2014|pisces
896|Even a Gemini has limits and it will be pretty clear over the next few days what they are. In areas where you are lacking in experience you must let others take the lead. Fortunately you are rarely lacking in common sense. |12-27-2014|pisces
897|The most important thing now and over the new year period is that you stay on good terms with partners and colleagues. No matter what others may say or do you must not overreact. Don’t make enemies of people who should be friends.|12-28-2014|pisces
898|You will be tempted to ignore some kind of problem today in the hope that it will go away – and you are right to do so. This is one of those problems that is only a problem if you think it is a problem. So don’t think of it at all. |12-29-2014|pisces
899|What happens over the next 24 hours will reassure you that everything is fine. In fact, by the time Venus moves in your favor next weekend you will come to the conclusion that you have been worrying for no good reason. |12-30-2014|pisces
900|If you are smart you won’t take what someone tells you too seriously today, especially if there is money at stake. If you fall for a story that is obviously untrue it will be you who pays for it in the long-term. |12-31-2014|pisces
901|Make an effort to pursue a new interest because the planets suggest it will become increasingly important to you over the next few months. Don’t worry that others think you are wasting your time – you will soon be having the time of your life. |01-01-2015|pisces
902|You have big plans for the future but make sure they are not too big. Even a Gemini has limits and your main task now is to identify what those limits are so you can work within them. It’s not about weakness, it’s about common sense. |01-02-2015|pisces
903|Positive thinking is a must this weekend because if you dwell on what is going wrong in your life you will miss all the wonderful things that are going right. Forget about your chores and do something purely for the fun of it. |01-03-2015|pisces
904|Wherever you go and whatever you do you will have no end of fun this week. The only dark cloud on the horizon is tomorrow’s full moon which may bring one or two money problems. Promise yourself you won’t spend too much. |01-04-2015|pisces
905|The more you worry about a money problem the more power you give it, so put it out of your mind and focus on something more positive. Looking back from later in the week you will realize there was nothing to worry about anyway. |01-05-2015|pisces
906|You will find yourself at odds with someone in a position of authority today and you may have no choice but to back down, even though you believe you are in the right. It’s simply not worth putting your livelihood at risk. |01-06-2015|pisces
907|Your current big idea may indeed be wonderful but don’t shout about it too loudly. In fact you should keep it to yourself at least until the end of the week – by which time you will most likely have changed your mind. |01-07-2015|pisces
908|You will find yourself in a heated discussion with a friend or work colleague today and no way are you going to back down. Why should you when you know that you are right and they are wrong? There is no need to compromise. |01-08-2015|pisces
909|If you are having second thoughts about something you recently agreed to there is still time to change your mind. Others may not be happy about it but your conscience must come first. Better you pull out now than hate yourself later. |01-09-2015|pisces
910|You may have been tough on various people in recent weeks but you will be a lot more friendly over the next 48 hours. You have been Mr. Nasty and now it is time to be Mr. Nice. If nothing else it will keep your rivals confused.|01-10-2015|pisces
911|Someone in a position of power may give you a tough time during the early part of the week but that’s okay because you can be pretty tough yourself when the need arises. You have both right and might on your side, so use them.|01-11-2015|pisces
912|Whatever you want out of life you will find a way to get, but you will get it quicker and easier if you make friends with important people, the kind who can open doors and make things happen for you. You can’t do it all by yourself. |01-12-2015|pisces
913|A co-worker will give you a hard time over the next 24 hours but you must not give them a hard time back. The only thing they can do to actually hurt you is to provoke you into making an angry response. Don’t fall for it. |01-13-2015|pisces
914|With your ruler Mercury so strong today you are in a can-do mood but you may have to deal with people who seem incapable of making even the simplest decision for themselves. Yes, it’s frustrating but don’t lose your temper. |01-14-2015|pisces
915|Winning may not be everything but it isn’t nothing either and if you get the chance to be number one today you should take it. Mars in the career area of your chart makes it easy for you to be assertive – but don’t push it too far.|01-15-2015|pisces
916|If you force yourself to be enthusiastic about a task or project you don’t really care about today you may be surprised to find that you actually quite enjoy it. You will certainly impress everyone by your dedication to duty. |01-16-2015|pisces
917|You are determined to get more out of life and because you can sense that the clock is ticking you will deal harshly with anyone who stands in your way this weekend. But what kind of fool would dare to do that? |01-17-2015|pisces
918|Anyone who thinks that you will change your plans to fit in with what they want to do clearly does not know you too well. In fact you will go out of your way to do things your way – just to let them know you’re the boss! |01-19-2015|pisces
919|So many of the things you have been worrying about will fade away over the next few days. It’s doubtful whether they existed in the first place but the important thing is you feel free at last. How are you going to use that freedom? |01-20-2015|pisces
920|If your sixth sense tells you that someone is not being honest with you then, yes, you should be on your guard. But don’t make accusations unless you can back them up with facts. You’ll look bad if you get it wrong.|01-21-2015|pisces
921|Someone more experienced than you will take you under their wing over the next few days and teach you a number of things worth knowing. Amazingly they won’t ask for a favor in return – they just want to see you do well.|01-22-2015|pisces
922|Someone you think of very highly indeed has been waiting for you to declare your friendship, and maybe even your passion, and if you do it today your relationship will go from good to great. So what are you waiting for?|01-23-2015|pisces
923|A colleague will be less than helpful over the next 48 hours – in fact it seems they are being obstructive for the sake of it. Stay calm. If they see that it’s getting to you it will encourage them all the more. |01-24-2015|pisces
924|You have been a bit too suspicious in recent days but you will more than make up for it this week. Colleagues will be impressed by your willingness to work as part of the team – provided, of course, there is something in it for you. |01-25-2015|pisces
925|Force yourself to look on the bright side today. According to the planets you have nothing to worry about but you may have to trick your mind into believing that is so. Focus only on good things and only good things will happen. |01-26-2015|pisces
926|You seem to be in two minds which way you should now be heading. The best thing to do is wait until the end of the week when your confidence will return and you are far more likely to make the correct decision.|01-27-2015|pisces
927|A friend or relative will go out of their way to do something they hope you approve of today. Even if you are not that impressed you should pretend that you are, because if you help them feel good now they will help you big time later on. |01-28-2015|pisces
928|Anyone who doubts you are a free-thinker won’t doubt it much longer. In fact, what you profess to believe over the next 24 hours will mark you out as a maverick. Are you mad or are you bad? Neither, you’re a Gemini! |01-29-2015|pisces
929|Your main aim today and over the weekend must be to push yourself harder and get the best from yourself. Believe in your abilities and believe that you are capable of more and, in time, your belief will make it a fact.|01-30-2015|pisces
930|You would be wise not to make too many plans over the next 48 hours. And don’t put too much trust in other people’s plans and promises either. According to the planets friends and colleagues will say anything to try to impress you.|01-31-2015|pisces
931|The coming week will be extremely lucky for you. So many things will go right that it’s like you have a special angel watching over you. Maybe you have, maybe the good fortune fairy is on your side. Make the most of it.|02-01-2015|pisces
932|The coming week will be a time of great activity. You know what you want, you know where to get it – now all you have to do is find the confidence to reach out and take it. That will be easier than you imagine. |02-02-2015|pisces
933|The only danger today is that you will change your plans at the last possible moment and by doing so upset other people’s aims. It may not bother you now but it will do later when they change their own plans just to annoy you. |02-03-2015|pisces
934|You have done plenty of thinking and planning, now you must act. Don’t be half-hearted about what needs to be done – dedicate yourself to it body, mind and soul. You may be small but you can have a huge impact.|02-04-2015|pisces
935|You need to make an important decision today and you need some peace and quiet so you can think and, hopefully, come to the correct conclusion. Find a place where the noise of everyday life cannot interfere with your thoughts. |02-05-2015|pisces
936|Your confidence may take a dive today but it’s no big deal. As a Gemini you are rarely down for long and come the weekend you will be full of life and laughter again. There will be love in your life too. |02-06-2015|pisces
937|If you want to move up in the world then you must make an effort to impress people in positions of power. But don’t make too big a deal of it because they will be most impressed if you make it look easy.|02-07-2015|pisces
938|Mercury, your ruler, ends its current retrograde phase on Wednesday, after which you will find it so much easier to make others understand what it is you are trying to say. If you’re really fortunate you may even understand it yourself! |02-08-2015|pisces
939|There can be no more excuses for putting off something you should have taken care of a long time ago. You can and you must find a way to get it done – all it takes is a bit of imagination followed by lots of application.|02-09-2015|pisces
940|Someone in a position of authority will be rather critical of your work today but don’t lose heart. They know you have what it takes to succeed but they think you could do with a little push to get you going. They could be right. |02-10-2015|pisces
941|Be careful who you trust on the work front today because someone you think is a friend could be plotting to undermine your position. If you let them in on a secret they could find a way to use it against you. |02-11-2015|pisces
942|You are in one of those moods when whatever other people say you feel you have to take an opposing viewpoint. Are you being contrary for the fun of it? Maybe but what of it? Someone needs to ask the difficult questions. |02-12-2015|pisces
943|Question everything you are told today. Don’t accept things just because the “experts” tell you they are true. All too often the “experts” are actually nothing of the sort. Always think for yourself – don’t let others do it for you.|02-13-2015|pisces
944|Wait a day or two before confronting someone with evidence of their wrongdoing. At the moment the evidence you have is not as watertight as you would like to believe, but they will incriminate themselves further over the weekend.|02-14-2015|pisces
945|As the Sun moves into the career area of your chart this week you will have to decide if your old ambitions are worth pursuing and, if not, what you are going to pursue instead. Listen to your heart – it knows what to do. |02-15-2015|pisces
946|It may at times seem as if life is conspiring against you but what happens over the coming week will convince you that is simply not true. You may even be a little ashamed that you felt so sorry for yourself. |02-16-2015|pisces
947|You will need to keep a cool head today because something is going to happen that has others running around in all directions and getting nowhere fast. Your laid-back attitude will do a lot to restore calm to the scene. |02-17-2015|pisces
948|The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart today means you can win friends and influence people – IF you make the effort. Employers and other important people will admire your self-belief and your can-do attitude. |02-18-2015|pisces
949|According to the planets you are looking for excuses to avoid something that must be done. The simple fact is you don’t have a choice in the matter: you made an agreement and now you must keep it. Next time, don’t make promises so easily.|02-19-2015|pisces
950|You are so incredibly enthusiastic about something that you cannot understand why some people are being so negative about it. Maybe it’s because they have looked at the situation in a more balanced way. Maybe they have a point.|02-20-2015|pisces
951|You will find it easier than ever to get your own way, both in your personal life and at work, over the next 48 hours – all you have to do is ask. And no, there is no reason at all why you should be suspicious. There’s no catch. |02-21-2015|pisces
952|This is a good time to make an impression on employers and people in positions of authority. If you desire a promotion now is the time to do something that makes others sit up and take notice. Just make sure it’s moral, and legal. |02-22-2015|pisces
953|Just because you disagree with someone does not mean you cannot be friends. The message of the stars today – and for the rest of the week – is that differences of opinion must not be allowed to come between you. |02-23-2015|pisces
954|Someone in a position of power will say something that annoys you today, not least because it seems to cast doubts on your expertise. Don’t take it too seriously: either they did not mean it that way or they don’t know what they are talking about.|02-24-2015|pisces
955|Something you have been worrying about for ages is of no real importance and what happens today will convince you of that fact once and for all. In future, try not to take what the so-called “experts” say as gospel. Listen to your inner voice instead.|02-25-2015|pisces
956|Something you hear from a friend or work colleague today will make you wonder if you have taken a wrong turning. You certainly seem to be on a difficult path at the moment, so maybe you should retrace your footsteps and start again.|02-26-2015|pisces
957|By all means ask other people for their opinions today but don’t let what they say bind you to a certain course of action. Others will respect you more if you act according to your own principles – which, presumably, you do have.|02-27-2015|pisces
958|Try not to get too excitable over the next 48 hours because if you do you might go too far and say or do something you later regret. Everyone’s emotions are a bit too close to the surface at the moment, so tread carefully.|02-28-2015|pisces
959|You will be the center of attention this week and you will enjoy it immensely. Family, friends and even total strangers will want to get close to you and you may have to ration your appearances in public. It’s exhausting being a star!|03-01-2015|pisces
960|You will be in a helpful mood over the next 24 hours and eager to do favors for those who require them. But don’t force yourself on those who have not expressly asked you to help. Some people actually prefer to suffer in silence. |03-02-2015|pisces
961|You will make an important decision today, quite possibly the single most important decision you will make for months to come. Certain people will kick up a fuss and say you have got it wrong but that will just confirm you have got it right.|03-03-2015|pisces
962|Honesty is the best policy today, even if it means you hurt someone’s feelings by calling it as you see it. Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind and according to the planets now is the perfect time to spell out a few home truths.|03-04-2015|pisces
963|The planets warn you are expecting too much of yourself and must adjust your ambitions to a more practical level. Also, don’t get uptight if a friend or relative tells you something you don’t want to hear – they are trying to help.|03-05-2015|pisces
964|If you go to extremes today it will cause more problems than it solves, especially on the work front where you would be wise not to change routines and methods you have grown used to. Believe it or not things are fine just as they are.|03-06-2015|pisces
965|Someone who has let you down in the past will ask you to help them out over the next 48 hours and, not surprisingly, you will be reluctant to do so. According to the planets though you should forgive and forget. They won’t let you down again.|03-07-2015|pisces
966|Friendship and luck will go together over the coming week, so make time for colleagues ad loved ones and you will benefit in ways you may not have expected. You will be at your best when you are at the center of a crowd.|03-08-2015|pisces
967|It may seem as if the world is falling apart but it really isn’t that bad, and what is bad is part of a larger plan. Just because you cannot see the big picture at the moment does not mean the big picture does not exist. |03-09-2015|pisces
968|The dice are loaded in your favor at the moment – all you have to do is throw them with confidence. On the work front especially you need to take a few risks. Let people in positions of power see you are a force to be reckoned with.|03-10-2015|pisces
969|Make sure your ambitions are not too outrageous because if they are you may fall short of what you expect of yourself and your confidence will suffer. You may be a go-getting Gemini but you have limits like everyone else.|03-11-2015|pisces
970|Know your limits and stay within them. That is very much the message of the stars for you between now and the start of next week. No matter how far or fast you travel it’s likely that something will bring you back to earth with a bump.|03-12-2015|pisces
971|Mercury, planet of the mind, moves into the career area of your chart today and that means the more you think ahead and make plans now the more success you will enjoy later in the year. Don’t limit your ambitions. Think big. |03-13-2015|pisces
972|Have you bitten off more than you can chew? Maybe, but don’t worry about it because whatever new duties or chores you have taken on the planets indicate they will get easier over the weekend – and easier still next week.|03-14-2015|pisces
973|Any bad news you’ve had in recent days will be eclipsed by the good news that comes that comes to you as the new week gets under way. Your hopes and dreams will get a major boost when the Sun changes signs on Friday. Something to look forward to! |03-15-2015|pisces
974|Plan ahead and leave yourself plenty of time to reach your destination. Some days you can leave everything to the last minute and the adrenaline rush will get you through, but today you have got to be organized. Unless you enjoy getting lost. |03-16-2015|pisces
975|What you want you usually manage to get and that will certainly be the case today. The only problem is you may be so heavy-handed that even your friends get annoyed with you. Think before you speak before you act.|03-17-2015|pisces
976|If your instincts tell you that what you are being asked to go along with is not a good idea then make your excuses and don’t get involved. It may make you unpopular in certain circles but better unpopular than broke financially.|03-18-2015|pisces
977|Watch what you say today because if you let slip something that people in positions of authority find offensive it could damage your reputation. It may seem like a good joke to you but you know how touchy some people can be. |03-19-2015|pisces
978|Why are you making a simple situation look so difficult? According to the planets you need to ignore other people’s advice and go back to basics. Start by asking yourself how and why you have arrived at your current position. |03-20-2015|pisces
979|For every problem there is an answer and the problem you are struggling with will most likely resolve itself if you leave it alone. You may even realize that it’s not a problem at all – you have just been looking at it the wrong way. |03-21-2015|pisces
980|Now is the time to impress someone in a position of authority. Your ideas are as good as anyone else’s and better than most, so speak up and make yourself heard and it won’t be long before others are trying to impress you. |03-22-2015|pisces
981|You will find it hard to hide your emotions over the next 24 hours. Even if you keep your mouth firmly shut your body language will give you away. That’s good. It won’t do any harm to let others know you have feelings too. |03-23-2015|pisces
982|Don’t worry too much if you don’t get much done over the next 24 hours – you will more than make up for it later. Give your mind and body a rest and do what makes you feel good rather than what gets you ahead.|03-24-2015|pisces
983|Something will take you by surprise today and you have only yourself to blame. The signs have been there for some time and you should have seen it coming. Still, as a Gemini you like surprises, so maybe it won’t be so bad. |03-25-2015|pisces
984|Anyone who thinks you are superficial obviously does not know you very well at all. Over the next few days you will be looking for answers to some of life’s really big questions, the kind that most people do not even know exist.|03-26-2015|pisces
985|Make sure you are on the move today because the more people you meet and the more contacts you make the more opportunities will come your way in the near future. There is also a chance you could meet someone new to love.|03-27-2015|pisces
986|You may have to limit your social life this weekend as unexpected events force you to take care of more serious matters. If you think you are missing out, don’t worry – you will more than make up for it next week.|03-28-2015|pisces
987|Mercury, your ruler, moves in your favor on Tuesday and it won’t be long before you have forgotten all about your worries and woes. Also, the more loose ends you tie up early in the week the less likely it is they will trip you up. |03-29-2015|pisces
988|The consequences of something you did weeks and maybe even months ago will catch up with you over the next few days. That might sound a bit worrying but chances are it will be quite enjoyable, and maybe profitable too. |03-30-2015|pisces
989|You seem to believe that you cannot be a success unless you take large risks – and that could be a dangerous assumption. A couple of days from now your luck will change for the better so, if you must roll the dice, wait until then.|03-31-2015|pisces
990|You may be lacking in self-belief at the moment but it need not be a problem. Whatever you feel about your prospects if you just keep plugging away you WILL accomplish something worthwhile. Others think highly of you even if you do not.|04-01-2015|pisces
991|You will find it easy to convince others to agree with you over the next 24 hours, not because you are forceful but because you know what words push what buttons for maximum effect. Your powers of communication are at a peak. Use them.|04-02-2015|pisces
992|You just know that something special is going to happen, that it’s only a matter of time before your talents are rewarded. That may be true but what occurs over the next few days is an opportunity, nothing more – you have to make the most of it.|04-03-2015|pisces
993|Today’s lunar eclipse could make you somewhat impulsive but that may be no bad thing, especially if you have been too cautious of late. But don’t go to extremes and do something that cannot possibly work – unless you believe in miracles.|04-04-2015|pisces
994|No matter how often you have clashed with certain people in the past you can get on with them now. The fact is your aims are not really that different, so move on from the past and resolve to face the future together. |04-05-2015|pisces
995|Take the initiative in group and social activities over the next 24 hours. Not only will you will be immensely popular but you will also meet people who transform your outlook on life. What you dream about today you will be doing tomorrow.|04-06-2015|pisces
996|Avoid getting involved in disputes that have nothing to do with you. Some of your friends may get angry that you are not prepared to stick up for them but if you take their side today every other side will be against you tomorrow.|04-07-2015|pisces
997|The planets are moving in your favor now, so think positive and positive things are sure to occur. If you are in any way artistic you can create something special over the next few weeks, something of which you can be proud.|04-08-2015|pisces
998|You usually get what you want in the long-term – your powers of persuasion are legendary – and you will find it easier than ever to get what you want today. Just open your mouth and ask – you’ll be amazed what others agree to.|04-09-2015|pisces
999|Family matters are under excellent stars at the moment, so if you need to get back on good terms with a loved one now is the time to kiss and make up. It will also be possible to breath new life into a business relationship.|04-10-2015|pisces
1000|Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your birth sign this weekend, so anything to do with relationships will go well for you now. Artistic activities are also well starred, so if you have a talent of some kind now is the time to use it.|04-11-2015|pisces
1001|If someone tries to take liberties with your generous nature this week you must come down on them hard. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your career. Under no circumstances take on other people’s work.|04-12-2015|pisces
1002|If you want to make a difference in the world then you must push your ego to one side and learn to work with other people. No matter how strong-willed a Gemini you happen to be you can’t do it all on your own. |04-13-2015|pisces
1003|What happens today will plant a seed of doubt in your mind and it will rapidly reach the point where you can no longer deny that something is wrong. That’s good: once you know what’s wrong you can take steps to fix it.|04-14-2015|pisces
1004|Venus in your sign makes this a good time for affairs of the heart and anything of an artistic or creative nature, but Saturn is also strong at the moment, which means you must not lose your grip on reality. Common sense is king.|04-15-2015|pisces
1005|Someone you meet while on the move will be fun but are they trustworthy? The planets warn that you must not let your guard down because if you give away a secret about yourself today it won’t be long before everyone knows about it.|04-17-2015|pisces
1006|Spend quality time with your closest friends today, because something you hear while laughing and lunching together could have a major impact on your life over the next few months, or years, or decades – yes, it really could be that big.|04-18-2015|pisces
1007|Others will be free with their advice today, and that’s nice of them, but you will ignore each and every word of it. As far as you are concerned if there is advice to be given you are the one who should be giving it! |04-19-2015|pisces
1008|You are in one of your romantic moods at the moment and the next few days could be special for affairs of the heart. But you also have some thinking to do, so set aside an hour or two where you can be alone with your ideas.|04-20-2015|pisces
1009|Work will be the dominant theme later in the week, so make the most of your freedom to come and go as you please now. As a Gemini you like to get out and about and meet new people – so what are you waiting for?|04-21-2015|pisces
1010|Mercury, your ruler, links nicely with both Mars and Pluto today, so chances are you will be assertive in the extreme. Just be careful you don’t create confrontations where none need to exist. People are not the enemy – well, most of the time.|04-22-2015|pisces
1011|This is a time for reflection, a time for looking back over the previous 12 months or so and learning what you can from both your successes and your failures. Most likely the former outweigh the latter by at least three to one, so cheer up.|04-23-2015|pisces
1012|It might be a smart idea to adopt a low profile today. The planets warn there are some angry people out there in the big, bad world, so keep your head down and don’t call attention to yourself. Arguments are the last thing you need. |04-24-2015|pisces
1013|Don’t try to ram your ideas and opinions down other people’s throats – it will be hugely counter-productive. Others are entitled to see things differently than you, so accept that your outlooks clash. It should be easy enough to live and let live. |04-25-2015|pisces
1014|Avoid petty arguments, because the more you get involved in minor disputes the less time and energy you will have for dealing with the truly important stuff. Also, avoid worrying about events over which you have no control. There’s no percentage in it. |04-26-2015|pisces
1015|You will clash with someone whose opinions you don’t much like today, but if you stay calm and think logically you may discover that what they are saying has an element of truth in it. Never be afraid to admit you were wrong.|04-27-2015|pisces
1016|You may be tempted to bend the rules a bit today but the planets warn you won’t gain much if you do. Not only that but later in the week your conscience will nag at you. Play by the book – you will still be a winner.|04-28-2015|pisces
1017|You may not be happy with some of the changes taking place at the moment but your instincts tell you that you will benefit from them in some way, so keep your doubts to yourself and don’t make waves – you don’t want to sink!|04-29-2015|pisces
1018|Your ruler Mercury moves into your sign tomorrow and within a matter of hours you will feel the difference in a number of ways. Put the past behind you once and for all and focus only on the bright days to come, of which there will be many.|04-30-2015|pisces
1019|It is time to seize the initiative, declare your independence and start something new. With Mercury, your ruler, moving into your own sign today you can be sure that whatever you begin will be stamped with the mark of success.|05-01-2015|pisces
1020|If you are honest about what it is you are hoping to achieve this weekend then others will be honest with you about whether or not they can help. The worst thing you can do now is to keep your plans to yourself. |05-02-2015|pisces
1021|Your ideas may seem outrageous to those who do not share your vision but if they make sense to you then nothing else matters. No idea should be considered taboo over the coming week – the fact is you have the power to make it work. |05-03-2015|pisces
1022|If a friend asks you to do something you disagree with today you must have the strength to refuse their request. Even if it puts a strain on your relationship in the short-term in the long-term they will admit it was the right thing to do. |05-04-2015|pisces
1023|Under no circumstances agree to do someone else’s work for them today. Yes, of course, you would most likely make a better job of it but that’s not the point. They should be doing things for you, not the other way round.|05-05-2015|pisces
1024|Travel and social plans will go well today and if you can find a way to combine the two they will go even better. News from afar is likely too, perhaps from someone you last saw on less than friendly terms. Time to make up. |05-06-2015|pisces
1025|Whatever else you do today do not put money before love. If you want to impress someone who means a lot to you then do whatever it takes and don’t worry how much it may cost. Whatever the price it will be worth it.|05-07-2015|pisces
1026|It might be a good idea to take it easy for the next few days, or what passes for easy in the Gemini universe. When Mars moves into your sign early next week there will be no holding you back, so get plenty of rest now.|05-08-2015|pisces
1027|Lady Luck will smile on you this weekend but you must not allow that to mislead you into thinking that you can do what you like and get away with it. Just because one good thing happens does not mean you can take silly risks. |05-09-2015|pisces
1028|One of the best times of the year for you begins on Tuesday when Mars moves into your sign. You will be a lot more active and a lot more ambitious, but more importantly you will put your own needs first for a change. |05-10-2015|pisces
1029|You don’t like to be suspicious but if someone offers you something for nothing today it will pay you to find out if they are up to something. Chances are the offer is on the level but you can never be too careful. |05-11-2015|pisces
1030|You may not be in the mood for compromise today but you should make the effort anyway. Even with Mars now moving into your sign there will be some things that you can only do hand-in-hand with others. Don’t be too individualistic.|05-12-2015|pisces
1031|This should be an enjoyable time for you but if you are behind in your chores you may decide to give the fun stuff a miss and catch up on your workload. Do give yourself the occasional break though, if only to recharge your batteries.|12-01-2013|pisces
1032|It may be better to give than to receive but sometimes you wonder why it seems to be you who does all the giving while others do all the receiving. Never mind: within a matter of days your generosity will be rewarded.|12-02-2013|pisces
1033|If you change your mind about something today you will most likely have to change it back again later in the week, so stick with the decision you recently made and see it through to the end. What happened to that resolute Cancer nature?|12-03-2013|pisces
1034|If someone is difficult to get along with today you should make it your business to find out why. Most likely it is nothing too serious and may even be something you are able to help with. Then they’ll adore as well as respect you!|12-04-2013|pisces
1035|You have much to do over the next 24 hours, so start early and don’t expect to get home until late. When your head hits the pillow tonight put all the worries of the day behind you. Tomorrow will be just as trying, so get some sleep. |12-05-2013|pisces
1036|You may be behind in your schedule at the moment but don’t worry about it. If anything you should be aiming to conserve your energy now, if only because by the early part of next week you will be working harder than ever.|12-06-2013|pisces
1037|You will encounter someone of an aggressive nature today but if you are smart you will resist the urge to hit back. With Mars moving into one of the more sensitive areas of your chart you must stay in control of your emotions.|12-07-2013|pisces
1038|A task you have to do may seem tiresome but once you get into it you will find it is not as tedious as you thought it would be. Having said which, get it out of the way as quickly as possible – there are still more fun things to focus on. |12-08-2013|pisces
1039|Jupiter in your sign is giving you plenty of big ideas but because the planet of expansion is moving retrograde at the moment you must take care. If your ideas are too big you may over-extend yourself and cause big problems.|12-09-2013|pisces
1040|You don’t lack for confidence and you don’t lack for ideas but there is a danger today that you could mislead yourself about the true state of your affairs. Think positive by all means but don’t let wishful thinking take a hold on you.|12-10-2013|pisces
1041|Feuds and power struggles are best avoided, even if it means you have to go off and be by yourself for a while. Do not, under any circumstances, make the mistake of taking sides – in the long-term they may both turn on you.|12-11-2013|pisces
1042|It may be true that someone is saying awkward or embarrassing things about you but there is no reason to get paranoid and start thinking everyone is against you. Whatever you have done you are still most people’s number one.|12-12-2013|pisces
1043|You will get exactly what you deserve today: no more and no less. Jupiter in your sign links with Saturn in a way that guarantees you get out of life in direct proportion to what you’ve put in. And you’ve put in a lot.|12-13-2013|pisces
1044|Loved ones may be a bit touchy over the next 48 hours, so watch what you say and don’t be tempted to stir things up. If they really do get too miserable to bear just go some place where the vibes are more to your liking.|12-14-2013|pisces
1045|A full moon in the most sensitive area of your chart this week is liable to have you believing that small setbacks are of huge significance. You’ve been to this place before in your mind – do you really want to go there again?|12-15-2013|pisces
1046|As some of your views are a bit controversial there could be some interesting skirmishes today. But don’t make a scene if someone who disagrees with you challenges your grasp of the facts. Stay calm and prove them wrong|12-16-2013|pisces
1047|Do others have your best interests at heart? Maybe they do, maybe they don’t but why leave it to chance? Money matters and business issues are a minefield, so tread carefully and make sure you are not being cheated.|12-17-2013|pisces
1048||12-18-2013|pisces
1049|It may seem as if someone is trying to undermine your position, and maybe they are, but there is no need to worry about it. In a matter of days something will happen that removes them from the scene, while making you more visible.|12-19-2013|pisces
1050|You would be wise to be on your guard over the next 24 hours as the planets warn someone you work or do business with is being more than a little deceitful. Don’t judge others by what they say, judge them by what they do.|12-20-2013|pisces
1051|It seems you have come in for a bit of criticism of late and although not all of it was deserved you have to admit some of it was. The question is: have you learned from your mistakes? You should find out the answer this weekend.|12-21-2013|pisces
1052|You may find that everyday tasks become even more of a chore over the next few days but don’t worry. Whatever challenges you are called on to face you will handle them, if not with ease, then at least with courage and confidence.|12-22-2013|pisces
1053|It would be wise to take what other people say with a large pinch of salt today – most likely it is the exact opposite of what they really mean. Don’t trust anyone but yourself over the next 24 hours. You don’t need advice anyway.|12-23-2013|pisces
1054|Although the Sun in Capricorn brings partnership problems to the fore, Mercury in your opposite sign will make it easier for you to see things from the other person’s point of view. Make sure they see your point of view too though.|12-24-2013|pisces
1055|Try not to jump to conclusions today or tomorrow because most likely they will be wide of the mark. Mars and Uranus together warn that your logic circuits cannot be trusted – and your intuition may be temporarily faulty too.|12-25-2013|pisces
1056|Your problems are not as bad as you think, so quit worrying. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Capricorn will bring relationship matters to a head over the next few weeks, but there is no need to panic – you will survive.|12-26-2013|pisces
1057|This is one of the best times of the year for partnerships and for affairs of the heart in particular. With the Sun, Venus and Mercury all moving through the relationship area of your chart your charm and charisma will work wonders.|12-27-2013|pisces
1058|Don’t judge yourself by other people’s standards because they are simply not high enough. The planets suggest there is nothing you cannot do if you want it enough. Plant a new seed this weekend and watch it bloom in the new year.|12-28-2013|pisces
1059|A new moon at the very start of the year urges you to express yourself fully and emotionally, even if you are the kind of Cancerian who does not usually like to let others know how you feel. If you open up now it could prevent trouble later.|12-29-2013|pisces
1060|Whatever you do someone is sure to moan about it. In fact, over the next few days you will have to put up with so many petty complaints that you may want to scream. Close your ears and pretend the critics and cynics don’t exist.|12-30-2013|pisces
1061|Fight for your rights. Stand up for yourself and what you believe in. The only reason certain people are willing to oppose you is because you have given them the impression that you are weak. Time to set the record straight. |12-31-2013|pisces
1062|Stop trying to control each and every situation you find yourself in and just let things happen. That is the message of the stars for you now and if you follow it you will be extremely happy. Others will be happy that you are not so uptight too.|01-01-2014|pisces
1063|Try to give loved ones a bit more freedom today and tomorrow. It’s not enough just to say that you trust them you’ve got to show it too. Besides, the more you try to control other people the more you encourage them to break away.|01-02-2014|pisces
1064|You may be feeling sorry for yourself at the moment, especially if you feel rejected by someone you have feelings for. Most likely you’ve got completely the wrong end of the stick, so buck up your ideas and stop being so feeble!|01-04-2014|pisces
1065|With Venus and Mercury nicely aligned this week you will want to be friends with everyone. You will also find it easier to make the first move in personal relationships. You have been keeping your feelings to yourself for too long.|01-05-2014|pisces
1066|You are about to make a hugely important decision, one that could change the course of your life. It may not be the change itself that worries you so much as how others are going to react. Don’t worry, they’ll get used to it.|01-06-2014|pisces
1067|You may not enjoy what happens today, not least because you have no control over events, but if you just accept it and refuse to be upset then maybe it won’t be so bad. One thing you can always control is the way you react. |01-07-2014|pisces
1068|Why are you so pessimistic about your prospects? You may not have got everything you wanted in recent months but there is always tomorrow and all the days after that. You’ll feel more positive the closer you get to the weekend.|01-08-2014|pisces
1069|If someone whose judgment you trust urges you to really go for it today you must act immediately. Too often in the past you have been too careful and missed out – now go to the other extreme and throw caution to the wind.|01-09-2014|pisces
1070|Be completely honest with everyone you deal with today, even if it means you hurt their feelings in some way. If you lie to them, even with the best of intentions, they will find out later and take it as a sign you cannot be trusted.|01-10-2014|pisces
1071||01-11-2014|pisces
1072|You can quite easily wriggle out of what you are expected to do this week, but you won’t be popular and your conscience will most likely nag at you. Why not just knuckle down and get it out of the way as quickly as you can?|01-12-2014|pisces
1073|Even if you disagree with someone on a point of principle you can still work together, so stay on good terms and seek a compromise solution. You may not be able to have things all your own way, but if you give a little you’ll gain a lot.|01-13-2014|pisces
1074|Think before you act over the next 24 hours, especially if your actions are likely to affect other people. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Capricorn means what you do to others will come back to you tenfold, for better or worse.|01-14-2014|pisces
1075|What happens tomorrow, when the moon is full in your sign, may seem extreme but who says life is supposed to be fair? The simple fact is others have the power to make the rules and you don’t, so adapt and survive. You’ll do okay.|01-15-2014|pisces
1076|You may have a hard time controlling your emotions today but in a way that’s good because, as usual, you have been keeping your feelings bottled up inside. Shout and scream if you have to – and even if you don’t have to!|01-16-2014|pisces
1077|You can and you should make yourself known to important people over the next 24 hours. People in positions of authority will be open to your ideas and before you know it you could find yourself promoted. All you need is self-belief.|01-17-2014|pisces
1078|Sometimes, once you cross a line there is no going back. Bear that thought in mind today before you do something you may not be able to undo later. Remember too that what seems amusing to you could be taken seriously by other people.|01-18-2014|pisces
1079|You may be tempted to own up to what you have done but the planets warn that may not be such a good idea. Most likely the person you are planning to confess to does not want to know about your sins. Say nothing and live with your guilt.|01-19-2014|pisces
1080|This is an extremely important time for money matters, so think before you act and act only in your own best interests. You will, however, have to work closely with other people. You won’t get where you want to go on your own.|01-20-2014|pisces
1081|Someone you do business with will put you on the spot and force you to choose between your ideals and your earnings. Just remember that if you compromise your principles once you will be expected to compromise them again and again.|01-21-2014|pisces
1082|Someone older and wiser will give you some excellent advice today, and if you are smart you will listen and learn. Don’t forget that there are more important things in life than material success, not the least of which is doing the right thing.|01-22-2014|pisces
1083|The more you say the less others will listen, so give your tongue a rest and use your eyes and ears to find out what is going on. Something you see or hear over the next 24 hours will give you something worth talking about later on.|01-23-2014|pisces
1084|Someone will come to you for advice about a personal matter and although you don’t want to get involved you know you can’t turn them down. But make sure they know it is only advice. The ultimate responsibility rests with them.|01-24-2014|pisces
1085|You may not be as forceful or as fearless as you have been of late over the weekend but that is probably no bad thing. The planets indicate it is time to slow down and stop trying to be first past the post in everything you do. For now.|01-25-2014|pisces
1086|A new beginning is possible but to make the most of it you are going to have to get rid of all the things you no longer need. You are carrying a lot of excess physical and emotional baggage. Now is the time to lighten your load.|01-26-2014|pisces
1087|Current cosmic activity makes you sensitive to changes in your environment, to the extent that you will sense when something is about to happen hours before it actually occurs. With that kind of advantage how can you possibly fail? You can’t!|01-27-2014|pisces
1088|Your confidence is high and you are intensely ambitious, but the planets warn that someone you think of as a friend is jealous of your success and plotting against you. Watch your back and watch what you say – don’t make it easy for them.|01-28-2014|pisces
1089|What you say and do now will, to a large extent, determine the level of material and professional success you will enjoy over the next few months. Don’t say and do what you think will please those in positions of power. Please yourself first.|01-29-2014|pisces
1090|Try to take things easy today because if you tire yourself out, physically or intellectually, it may take a while to recover. You don’t need to be as intense as you usually are. Everything will turn out for the best no matter what you do.|01-30-2014|pisces
1091|Some people think you are the best thing since sliced bread – and they’re right, you are. But don’t let all the flattery and adulation go to your head because there are other people who would like an excuse to take you down a peg or two.|01-31-2014|pisces
1092|The planets suggest that someone is about to make you an offer that is too good to be true and in your haste to be a success you might just fall for it. They say there is a sucker born every minute – make sure it’s not you.|02-01-2014|pisces
1093|It may seem as if you are at the mercy of events, that you are being swept along by forces over which you have no control, but is it true? Maybe you are taking too negative a view of your ability to influence events.|02-03-2014|pisces
1094|The most important thing over the next 24 hours is that you know when to speak up and when to stay silent. Important people will be either hugely impressed or hugely annoyed by what you have to say, so make sure you say the right thing.|02-04-2014|pisces
1095|Inspiration will come easy to you today, but no matter how fast your mind is working, don’t try to turn ideas into reality until later in the month. Carry a notepad — either real or electronic — with you wherever you go and keep your “To Do” list topped up. |02-05-2014|pisces
1096|As Mercury turns retrograde today you should take nothing for granted. But the world should not take you for granted either. Do something completely out of character, something no one would ever expect of you. Sometimes it’s good to shock.|02-06-2014|pisces
1097|Whatever kind of news you receive over the next 24 hours you are advised to keep an open mind. A couple of weeks from now you will have more important issues to deal with, so don’t take what you hear now too seriously.|02-07-2014|pisces
1098|What seems so important to you now won’t seem so important to you from the early part of next week. It’s not so much your attitude that has changed as your values: Ideas seem more exciting than making money and gaining possessions.|02-08-2014|pisces
1099|Don’t worry too much if not a lot is going right for you at the moment. Later in the week the tide will turn in your favor and you will be in control of your own destiny again. You have little to fear and lots to look forward to.|02-10-2014|pisces
1100|The answer to your money worries will appear soon, so stay calm and don’t do anything drastic. Sacrifices will have to be made but they won’t cause you too much pain, so long as you use your head — and the talents you were born with. |02-11-2014|pisces
1101|What other people don’t want you to know is exactly what you need to know right now, so start asking questions and don’t stop until you have found answers that make sense. Some of the things you discover will shock you.|02-12-2014|pisces
1102|Your mind may be working fast and you may have come to conclusions that satisfy you but can you be sure they are correct? Go deeper than your mind. Listen to your inner voice and act on what it tells you, even if you don’t understand it.|02-13-2014|pisces
1103|What looks confusing now will seem perfectly logical come the start of next week, so promise yourself that no matter what happens over the next two or three days you won’t let it worry you. That applies especially to money matters.|02-14-2014|pisces
1104|The planets will open your eyes to new possibilities over the next 48 hours and you won’t be slow to take advantage of them. You have all the energy and enthusiasm and self-belief you need – now all you need to do is get busy.|02-15-2014|pisces
1105|Try not to put yourself under unnecessary pressure as the new week begins. The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow will give your energy a boost but it’s not an invitation to go to extremes, either in your personal life or in your work.|02-17-2014|pisces
1106|Don’t waste time telling the world what you are going to do – just get on and do it and show you can walk the walk as well as talk the talk. Rarely have you been in such a no-nonsense mood. Rarely have your stars looked so good.|02-18-2014|pisces
1107|You may want to give voice to your feelings today, but is that really such a good idea? The planets warn you won’t do your cause much good if you let your resentments out for everyone to see. Act as if everything is fine — and it will be. |02-19-2014|pisces
1108|The time has come to move on, with no regrets, no backward glances and no promises that if things don’t work out you can always go back again. Draw a line in the sand, step across it and embrace the new you and the new future you have planned.|02-20-2014|pisces
1109|Whatever activities you had lined up for the next 24 hours you may have to think again because unforeseen events will change everything. You may also have to let go of a creative or artistic idea you were attached to. It isn’t going to work.|02-21-2014|pisces
1110|You don’t have to ask permission to come and go. It’s your life and you are entitled to live it how you please, and if certain people are not happy with that fact then maybe it’s time to ease them out of your life. Liberty is paramount.|02-22-2014|pisces
1111|You are entitled to believe whatever you want to believe and anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is not your friend and you must not waste time arguing with them. Make sure you use your right to think, speak and act as you see fit.|02-23-2014|pisces
1112|What happens over the next few days will introduce you to new ways of thinking and news ways of making sense of the world. What you discover will make you realize that a lot of what you were taught to believe was nonsense. Better late than never.|02-24-2014|pisces
1113|The Sun in Pisces boosts your confidence and make it easier to take chances. Not that you should push your luck at every opportunity but you do need to be a bit more adventurous. If you get the chance to travel then take it!|02-25-2014|pisces
1114|Even the experts get it wrong sometimes and if your hunches tell you that someone who occupies a position of power and influence does not know what they are talking about then by all means ignore them, and any advice they may give you.|02-26-2014|pisces
1115|You will need to close your ears to criticism today. It does not matter how good a job you do someone, somewhere will pick holes in your methods or techniques. Ignore them and carry on as before. You’re bigger and better than they are.|02-27-2014|pisces
1116|Be on the lookout for money-making opportunities but don’t go rushing after them the moment you spot them. As Mercury, planet of intellect and communication, turns direct again today you can afford to take your time and get it right.|02-28-2014|pisces
1117|Anyone who thinks you will sacrifice principles for profit has no idea what kind of person you are. You know the difference between right and wrong and you will follow the former no matter how much time and effort it takes.|03-01-2014|pisces
1118|Jupiter in your sign is an incredibly good influence but as the planet of expansion has been moving retrograde for some time you may not have noticed all the good things it’s been doing for you. You will begin to notice over the next few days.|03-02-2014|pisces
1119|Never doubt for a moment that you have what it takes to succeed. Never doubt for a moment that you belong at the top with the best. Today’s Sun-Pluto link will inspire you to believe that all things are possible. For you they are.|03-03-2014|pisces
1120|You seem to have made up your mind about an issue and the more others try to get you to see it in a different light the more determined you are to follow your own interpretation. That’s fine – so long as it’s the correct interpretation.|03-04-2014|pisces
1121|Everything is going so well for you at the moment that you may get a bit suspicious and wonder if it’s some kind of cosmic trick. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a genuine lucky streak, so make sure you enjoy it.|03-05-2014|pisces
1122|You have been a bit to cautious of late but now that Jupiter is moving in your favor again you will find the confidence to take a few risks. If you have not done it already you should be planning your next big adventure. In fact, make it huge.|03-06-2014|pisces
1123|The journey you have started on may be long and hard but you are determined to reach the end, and with Jupiter on your side again there is no doubt you will succeed. Do you believe that? You should. Self-belief is half the battle.|03-07-2014|pisces
1124|You have every right to express your opinions, even if – especially if – your opinions offend people in positions of power. Just because they are so high and mighty does not mean they are right. Free speech is sacrosanct, regardless of “facts”.|03-08-2014|pisces
1125|This is not the time to dwell on mistakes. The Sun in Pisces boosts your confidence and encourages you to aspire to new heights, both personally and professionally, so put the past behind you and make the coming week a huge success.|03-09-2014|pisces
1126|This can be and should be one of the most productive times of the year. The harder you work at making your dreams come true the quicker you will reach the goals you have set yourself – and then you can set yourself a few more.|03-11-2014|pisces
1127|The more others say you can trust them today the more cautious you should be. In any and all kinds of negotiations you must – repeat, must – get promises in writing at every stage. If you don’t, they will most likely turn out to be worthless.|03-12-2014|pisces
1128|There is no point dwelling on past mistakes. If you recently did something wrong then learn from it what you can, then put it behind you and move on. You’ll make mistakes tomorrow too, of course, but your successes will far outnumber them.|03-13-2014|pisces
1129|Speak up and let the world know what you are thinking. Some very important people will be listening to what you have to say today and if they like what they hear it won’t be long before the offers start coming in. It pays to be ambitious.|03-14-2014|pisces
1130|You won’t want to stay in one place or with one group of people over the next 48 hours. It does not matter what chores and duties need to be done, leave them until you are more in the mood. Be free to come and go as you please.|03-15-2014|pisces
1131|You will find plenty to be optimistic about over the next few days and when the Sun crosses the career angle of your chart on Thursday the ambitious side of your nature will come to the fore too. You’re going places – and fast.|03-16-2014|pisces
1132|Believe it or not there is a reason for everything that happens in life and that fact won’t change just because you can’t work out what it might be. Your task today, and for the coming week, is to trust in the universe, and in yourself.|03-17-2014|pisces
1133|Listen to what your conscience tells you today and ignore anyone who gives you conflicting advice. Too much of what others say is based on fear and ignorance and wishful thinking and is therefore of no lasting value. Listen to your heart.|03-18-2014|pisces
1134|Important people are watching you closely, so make sure they like what they see. The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart tomorrow will energize you and make you more ambitious than usual. Let the world know what you can do.|03-19-2014|pisces
1135|If you want to move up in the world then now is the time to get yourself noticed. It does not matter how much talent you have, what truly matters is that you have a clear goal in mind and that you go after it with everything you’ve got.|03-20-2014|pisces
1136|The most important thing today is that you make sure the facts and figures support your point of view. If you make claims, either socially or at work, that others find easy to show are false it won’t do your reputation a lot of good.|03-21-2014|pisces
1137|If you are serious about changing habits and routines that have outlived their usefulness you could not pick a better time to start. It’s not only old habits that could be on the way out – you may decide to change your whole way of life.|03-22-2014|pisces
1138|You are always ready with a helping hand but an overly generous approach may not work in your favour over the next seven days. Just this once maybe you should ask yourself if others deserve to have you looking out for them.|03-23-2014|pisces
1139|You will be able to twist people around your little finger today – no one will be immune to your charms. Is it right to use your talents in this way? Of course it is. All is fair in love, war and getting ahead in your career.|03-24-2014|pisces
1140|You need to understand that not everyone thinks and feels the same way as you. You may not be able to see things from another person’s point of view but you do have to recognize that they have a point of view – and that it’s valid.|03-25-2014|pisces
1141|You need to broaden your horizons. You need to realize there is more going on than you were previously aware of. Most of all you need to accept that in spite of all the bad things that go on in the world it is still a wonderful place.|03-26-2014|pisces
1142|Others can sense your self-confidence and because of that they want to do things for you – and who are you to refuse any offers? It will certainly give you more time to work on a creative project that should be finished very soon.|03-27-2014|pisces
1143|With communications planet Mercury linked to Pluto in your opposite sign today you won’t hesitate to call it as you see it. Some people may be shocked that you are so outspoken but you won’t care in the slightest – in fact you’ll be pleased.|03-28-2014|pisces
1144|You will enjoy what you have to do on the work front this weekend and because you enjoy it you will make a very good job of it and your reputation will soar. Important people will be impressed with the calm way you tackle difficult tasks.|03-29-2014|pisces
1145|Someone in a position of authority will put you to the test, most likely by confronting you with a problem they know is way outside your comfort zone. Don’t worry, they don’t expect you to get it “right”, they just want to see if you panic. |03-30-2014|pisces
1146|If there is a creative or artistic project you have been struggling to finish the next four or five days will be critical. Either give it your all and get it done or give up on it altogether and move on to something new.|03-31-2014|pisces
1147|If someone you have feelings for seems unresponsive today don’t think it means you are drifting apart. Most likely they just need to spend some time by themselves for a while to think things through. Give them the space they need.|04-01-2014|pisces
1148|If you need to make a decision concerning your career wait until the end of the week. The planets warn if you make it today you could end up moving in completely the wring direction. What’s the hurry? Take your time and get it right.|04-02-2014|pisces
1149|Try not to get angry with people who drag their feet or can’t make up their minds as quickly as you do. If you want to get things done you will either have to go it alone or make alliances with those who share your hunger for success.|04-03-2014|pisces
1150|You must make an effort to finish what you have started, because if you fall behind any further it may be impossible for you to catch up. Close your eyes and ears to distractions and focus on the one thing you really must get done.|04-04-2014|pisces
1151|There are people in your life who, no matter what you do to please them, will always be dissatisfied – so why bother trying in the first place? Your real friends appreciate you more than you will ever know, and they are the ones who count.|04-05-2014|pisces
1152|Certain people may try to make you feel bad by pointing out your shortcomings but no one is perfect, not even you, and the fact that you got something wrong is merely evidence that you tried to do something – when so few do.|04-06-2014|pisces

1156|You may want to help those less fortunate than you but think twice before volunteering for a task you know very little about. Others may be impressed by your enthusiasm but they won’t be so impressed if you make a mess of the job.|04-10-2014|pisces
1157|If you want to make a success of something you must get assistance. According to the planets you have taken it as far as you can on your own, now you must share the load with other people. It may be your baby but don’t be possessive.|04-11-2014|pisces
1158|You are not responsible for all the bad things that go on in the world, so try not to let what happens this weekend get you down. If there is something you can do to change things that’s great but, if not, just go with the flow.|04-12-2014|pisces

1166|It looks as if you are planning to commit yourself to a new plan or project but you should give it a few days before any final decision. Jupiter in your sign could encourage you to play up the possibilities while playing down the dangers.|04-20-2014|pisces

1170|Your confidence is high at the moment and will rise even higher over the next few days. Friendships and group activities are under excellent stars, so get out into the world and see and be seen. Your positive attitude is an inspiration.|04-24-2014|pisces
1171|No matter how much others might question your beliefs, if you are happy with them there is no reason to change. Yes, some of your ideas may seem irrational, but so what? Life is full of mysteries that not even the experts can answer.|04-25-2014|pisces

1173|It seems you are on some sort of personal crusade. If your cause is worth fighting for – and it is – you should have no trouble at all attracting the support of friends and family and colleagues, but don’t be too pushy about it.|04-27-2014|pisces
1174|Keep things simple over the next 24 hours and you won’t go far wrong. You know what it is that you want, you know where it is you can find it and there is nothing anyone can do to deny you your heart’s desire. It’s all good.|04-28-2014|pisces

1177|There is a danger that you will try to make the facts fit your assumptions – and if you do the consequences could be dire. Always strive to see life as it is, not as you wish it might be. Then and only then can you make a difference.|05-01-2014|pisces
1178|It seems you have been taking one particular friendship a bit too much for granted and if you let the situation carry on this way you may drift too far apart to ever get back together again. Give them a call and meet up for a night out.|05-02-2014|pisces
1179|You can easily make a good impression with your employer or others in positions of authority this weekend. Don’t forget though: just because you know what you are capable of does not mean everyone else knows. Spell it out for them.|05-03-2014|pisces

1185|What you hear today may annoy you but is it worth getting worked up about? Of course not. If you allow yourself to get angry by what other people say about you they will have succeeded in their aim. It’s only words after all.|05-09-2014|pisces
1186|Do what you want to do rather than what other people expect you to do. Having said that, you will gain more in the long-term if, at least some of the time, you join forces with like-minded people. Your goals and their goals are similar.|05-10-2014|pisces

1198|There are times when it is best to keep your feelings to yourself but this isn’t one of them. You may surprise yourself with the intensity of your emotions over the next 24 hours. You’ve been keeping too much inside – now let it all out.|05-22-2014|pisces

1204|Because today’s new moon falls in the most sensitive area of your chart perhaps your best course of action over the next 48 hours is to withdraw from the world for a bit. Start planning for the coming 12 months – they’re sure to be special.|05-28-2014|pisces

1223|Do you have a clear idea of what your long-term ambitions are going to be? If not you would be wise to get your thoughts in order over the next few days. You must be realistic about your plans – vague daydreams won’t come true.|06-16-2014|pisces

1265|The planets are trying to warn you that if you don’t make an effort to slow down you could end up crashing into an obstacle that has no give at all. Even a Cancerian needs to accept that they are not immune to failure, or pain.|07-28-2014|pisces
1266|You need to leave behind the hustle and bustle and find yourself a place where you can be alone with your thoughts. The more you contemplate the meaning of life over the next few days the more life will bless you later in the year.|07-29-2014|pisces
1267|You need to do something about your cash flow situation but you need to make sure it is the kind of something that does not risk everything. Is your position really so desperate? Or have you convinced yourself that things are worse than they are?|07-30-2014|pisces
1268|Don’t be too hard on yourself if you have not yet reached the heights you were aiming for. There is no time limit by which you have to be rich, famous or whatever else it is you think you should be. Besides, you always get another chance.|07-31-2014|pisces
1269|There are some days when, no matter how hard the task you have to take care of, everything comes easy to you, and this is one of them. Ask yourself what it is you would most like to achieve – then just go out and do it.|08-01-2014|pisces
1270|Money may be important to you but it’s not the only thing that makes you happy. The cosmic picture over the next 48 hours encourages you to forget about cash flow problems and focus on family and friends and affairs of the heart.|08-02-2014|pisces
1271|If you get the chance to travel you must take it, even if it means postponing other plans. People you meet while traveling, both in your own neighborhood and over longer distances, will bring you luck, and maybe love too.|08-03-2014|pisces
1272|You are under no obligation to be nice to people you don’t much like but if they are people whose assistance you might need in the near future it would be a wise move to stay in their good books, at least for the time being.|08-04-2014|pisces
1273|Your mind will expand in understanding and you will know in a flash what it is you have to do. After that it is up to you: you can accept the challenge and be special, or you can reject it and be mediocre like so many others.|08-05-2014|pisces
1274|The approaching full moon warns that if you carry on spending money at the present rate you will soon be out of cash. Maybe it’s time to be honest with yourself about how wasteful you have been lately – and why you have been so weak.|08-06-2014|pisces
1275|Sometimes you lack self-belief but the danger today is that you will go right the other way and try to prove yourself by undertaking a task that is clearly too much for you. Get the balance right: only do what you feel comfortable with.|08-07-2014|pisces
1276|Money may not be everything but it has its place in the world and with a little bit more of it you would be able to do some of the things you have often dreamed about. It’s time to start using your talents in a more focused way.|08-08-2014|pisces
1277|A craving of some sort will reach a peak and if you want peace of mind you will have to acknowledge your desires and do what you can to satisfy them. It’s really no big deal – everyone needs something to make them feel good.|08-09-2014|pisces
1278|It may be your style to avoid confrontation but something needs to be brought into the open where it can be discussed. Face up to what has come between you and a friend or lover or relative and find a way to deal with it.|08-10-2014|pisces
1279|It should be obvious by now that a friend or family member needs your assistance – so what are you waiting for? You know from your own experience how difficult it can be to ask for a helping hand, so make the first move.|08-11-2014|pisces
1280|So what if something has not worked out the way you expected? That’s life. You cannot have things your own way all of the time but you will always get another chance, so why worry? Look forward today, not back.|08-12-2014|pisces
1281|You may lose your temper today with someone who lets you down or disrupts your schedule – and they deserve it. Don’t feel guilty if you go over the top a bit because, sadly, that seems to be the only language they understand.|08-13-2014|pisces
1282|Mars and Pluto will combine over the next 48 hours to give your ego and energy a much-needed boost. You won’t lack for self-belief, so much so that you honestly believe all things are possible. Aim high, then go even higher.|08-14-2014|pisces
1283|You can’t seem to make up your mind which direction you should be moving, which is of course frustrating, but who says you have to make a decision? Maybe the planets are trying to tell you to sit tight and wait for a sign.|08-15-2014|pisces
1284|Keep your money in your pocket this weekend, because if you make one wrong move you will have to make several more moves to get back to where you were at the beginning, and that’s a serious waste of time and energy.|08-16-2014|pisces
1285|You may be reluctant to let loved ones know what is upsetting you but until you do no one will be able to help you. Everyone needs assistance once in a while, even a Cancer, so let those who care for you know what’s going on.|08-17-2014|pisces
1286|You need to get routine matters out of the way as early as possible, because the second half of the day will bring some lovely surprises. If a social invitation arrives out of the blue you must take it – it could change your life.|08-18-2014|pisces
1287|There is no point being careful all of the time but, on the other hand, if you go too far you may regret it. If a loved one warns you are sailing too close to the edge you should take heed and rein yourself in a bit.|08-19-2014|pisces
1288|There are times when you need to spend some time alone and such a time is now. You have a lot to think about and you can’t think straight with so much noise going on around you. Find a quiet space you can call your own.|08-20-2014|pisces
1289|The Sun’s change of signs at the weekend will get your mind moving a bit faster and maybe expand your vision as well. You will certainly begin to see the good things you somehow missed over the past few weeks. There’s plenty of them.|08-21-2014|pisces
1290|You know there are no shortcuts to success but with Mars, planet of action, moving in your favor now you have what it takes to reach the top. Make an extra special effort over the next few days. It will be worth it.|08-22-2014|pisces
1291|Your money worries should decrease a bit now but that does not mean you can forget about making changes. On the contrary, they are more necessary than ever, not least because you’ll get more social invitations – and that means more expense.|08-23-2014|pisces
1292|The pace of life will speed up quite dramatically over the next few days, so pace yourself sensibly and don’t get so caught up in the whirl of social activities that you leave precious little time for anything else. Focus on what matters.|08-24-2014|pisces
1293||08-26-2014|pisces
1294|Your way with words will help you out of a tight corner today. Just because it was fairly easy to talk your way out of trouble this time does not mean it will be so easy again. Next time, try not to be so provocative!|08-27-2014|pisces
1295|With Mars, planet of ego, moving through the most dynamic area of your chart you could not care less what other people think. If something appeals to your sense of adventure today you will go for it no matter what others say.|08-28-2014|pisces
1296|Some people just rub you up the wrong way and you will have to deal with at least one, and maybe several, such persons today. The important thing is that you realize you cannot change them – no more than they can change you.|08-29-2014|pisces
1297|If you get a bit snappy with the people around you today that’s a clear sign you need to let off steam. The best way to do that is to get physical. It doesn’t have to be excessive but it does have to get your heart pumping.|08-30-2014|pisces
1298|Your self-belief is a bit fragile at the moment and whatever the reason for that – and most likely there is no reason at all – you will turn the corner over the next few days and soon you’ll be smiling again. Worry is a useless emotion. |08-31-2014|pisces
1299|Any sacrifices you have to make today will come easy to you – and make a huge difference to people you care for. You will get the most satisfaction though from showing a loved one how to better take care of themselves.|09-01-2014|pisces
1300|Don’t be tempted to take on too much work today because if you do your standards may have to be lowered. No matter how much others may offer you to do more you must be strong and resist the temptation. It’s not just about money.|09-02-2014|pisces
1301|Today’s positive cosmic influences will smooth your path and make it easy for you to get from A to B with a minimum of fuss. Travel and social activities will go very well for you over the next few days. Having fun is what it’s all about.|09-03-2014|pisces
1302|Sit back, stop worrying and enjoy the ride. That is the message of the stars for you today and if you are smart you will heed it. Looking back you will realize you got worked up about certain issues for no good reason.|09-04-2014|pisces
1303|The planets will bring you into conflict this weekend with someone you usually get along with. Everything will be okay if you resolve to get past it quickly. Don’t let bad feelings linger. You have too much to do to waste time on petty vendettas.|09-05-2014|pisces
1304|Honesty is the best policy this weekend, especially if you are trying to help a friend or family member in some way. You won’t help them in the slightest if you tell a white lie just to make them feel better. Say what has to be said.|09-06-2014|pisces
1305|This week’s cosmic influences will bring you into contact with a wider range of people than usual and there will be no end of chances to put your point of view across about issues that are important to you. Just don’t be too pushy about it.|09-07-2014|pisces
1306|A problem that has been annoying you for weeks, maybe even months, can easily be resolved, provided you are willing to listen to advice. Sometimes it is easier for an outsider to point out our mistakes, no matter how embarrassing that might be.|09-08-2014|pisces
1307|Just because you failed at something does not mean you are a failure. The planets indicate that though you may have failed at one thing in recent weeks you have learned enough to make sure that next time you will succeed. Go for it.|09-09-2014|pisces
1308|If you have doubts about a project others are trying to get you involved in then by all means steer clear of it. Whatever they may say to the contrary there is something about it that does not feel right. Always trust your instincts.|09-10-2014|pisces
1309|This is generally a positive time for you but don’t take too much on trust or you may miss out on a golden opportunity. If you neglect something today it could come back to haunt you in the not too distant future.|09-11-2014|pisces
1310|This should be a day to remember for all the right reasons. New friendships will be made with ease and existing relationships will improve dramatically. The more you open up to others the more they will open up to you.|09-12-2014|pisces
1311|On the surface you appear calm but deep down your emotions are raging – and with good reason considering what you’ve had to put up with. Sooner or later you will have to make a stand against your critics. Make it sooner, like right now.|09-13-2014|pisces
1312|You may be bored with your present routine and desperate to break out of a rut but you also know you stand to lose quite a lot if you make the wrong choice about what you do next. Don’t be hasty, something good will come up very soon.|09-14-2014|pisces
1313|According to the planets you should follow a course you have navigated profitably before rather than set out in a new direction. Despite what some people may say to the contrary there is no need for any type of major change.|09-15-2014|pisces
1314|If what you previously thought was a brilliant idea has come to nothing, abandon it. You may be tempted to give it another go but is it worth it? Probably not. There are more interesting things you can spend your time on today.|09-16-2014|pisces
1315|Because recent months have been hectic for you there were a number of things you wanted to do but never quite got round to. Now you can begin to move in a more agreeable direction. Focus only on what brings a smile to your face.|09-17-2014|pisces
1316|Be careful that something you say to a loved one does not hurt them emotionally, Yes, of course, you have every right to express your opinion, but you also have a responsibility to think about what the consequences might be.|09-18-2014|pisces
1317|There will always be good days and bad days but there will be a lot more of the former if you change the way you assess what is “good” and what is “bad”. You can be far too hard on yourself at times. Laugh more.|09-19-2014|pisces
1318|You will find yourself attracted to someone whose outlook on life is very different to your own. If you begin a relationship will it work? Maybe, maybe not, but you won’t know until you try, so make this the weekend when you start finding out.|09-20-2014|pisces
1319|It will take more than logic and good sense to change a colleague’s mind about something this week – they are clearly determined not to budge. Why is that do you suppose? Could it be they know something you don’t? Find out.|09-21-2014|pisces
1320|You are torn between doing something you enjoy but which won’t bring much in the way of financial success, and doing something you don’t enjoy which could be profitable. You know the answer already: be true to your instincts – go for enjoyment.|09-22-2014|pisces
1321|Life could be a bit of a battlefield today. A lot depends on how you deal with your emotions, especially when people whose way of doing things you despise insist that you follow their example. Your principles may not allow you to do that.|09-23-2014|pisces
1322|A change of direction of some kind will be forced on you over the next few weeks and if you are smart you won’t try to fight it. You can sense that better times lie just ahead, but first you will need to give up your old ways.|09-24-2014|pisces
1323|The choices you make over the next few days will have a major impact on your social or professional reputation, so make them wisely. Above all don’t let other people rush you into cutting corners or cutting back on essentials. Do it right.|09-25-2014|pisces
1324|Take advantage of the Sun moving through Libra – one of the more laidback signs of the Zodiac – to sit back and relax. If you have not got something done by now chances are it will never see the light of day, so forget it.|09-26-2014|pisces
1325|Try to steer clear of other people’s problems over the next 48 hours, especially those of an emotional kind. Sometimes it is kinder to let those you love learn from their own mistakes, and this appears to be one of those occasions.|09-27-2014|pisces
1326|No doubt there is a valid reason why you feel you need to go on the attack, but make sure you pick the right fights over the next few days. Also, try not to annoy people it is in your interests to stay on good terms with.|09-28-2014|pisces
1327|You seem impatient to get rid of something that has been a central part of your life for years. Is that such a good idea? It may appear to have outlived its usefulness but the planets indicate there is something important it can still do for you.|09-29-2014|pisces
1328|You need to think deeply about important matters today but you also need to keep whatever conclusions you reach to yourself, at least for the time being. The breakthrough you desire will happen in its own good time – you don’t need to push it.|09-30-2014|pisces
1329|This may be an emotional time in your life but there are people who love you and are always there for you and if you are smart youwill call on them today. Not only will they ease your fears but they will make you laugh as well.|10-01-2014|pisces
1330|A positive attitude in the face of adversity is often enough to turn the tide, so look on the bright side today and don’t worry about tomorrow. The surge of confidence you feel should be enough to see you through this difficult phase.|10-02-2014|pisces
1331|You will find yourself attracted to an idea that is, to say the least, a little bit unusual over the next 24 hours. That’s okay. Even people as traditional as you have moments when their minds leap to a higher level. This could be one of them.|10-03-2014|pisces
1332|If you are convinced that a certain course of action is correct then go ahead and do it. Of course, deep down you may not be as convinced as you claim to be, but your Leo flair will see you through – it always does.|10-04-2014|pisces
1333|You may have to cause a bit of a scene over the next few days, especially if people expect you to do things you feel uncomfortable with. Far from damaging your reputation your assertiveness will be noted and admired. But don’t push it too far.|10-05-2014|pisces
1334|Emotions will run deep over the next few days, both your own and other people’s, so don’t be surprised if there are a few tears. But don’t take them too seriously either. In the greater scheme of things nothing of substance is likely to change.|10-06-2014|pisces
1335|Have faith in what your instincts tell you, even when the so-called experts tell you something completely different. What happens over the next few days will prove you right in every way, so stick to your guns – you’ll get the last laugh.|10-07-2014|pisces
1336|Don’t be fooled if a rival suddenly appears to give in over something you have been arguing about for weeks. Yes, it’s possible they are sincere but the lunar eclipse suggests otherwise. It will pay you to be suspicious over the next 24 hours.|10-08-2014|pisces
1337|You will learn as much from your mistakes today as you do from your successes, so be of good cheer and expect an upturn in your fortunes very soon. Not even a Cancer can get it right each and every time, but you get it right more than most.|10-09-2014|pisces
1338|It’s important that you are honest with yourself about the position you are in but you also need to be more optimistic. The fact is your financial situation is nowhere near as bleak as you have been painting it – and a solution is very close at hand.|10-10-2014|pisces
1339|A work or career difficulty you encounter this weekend can only be resolved if you approach it from an unusual angle. Whatever else happens don’t lose your temper because that will signal to rivals that they’ve got you on the run.|10-11-2014|pisces
1340|You can sense that something important is about to happen, something that will turn your world upside down. There is no reason to feel apprehensive – the planets suggest that whatever changes come about you will benefit in remarkable ways. |10-12-2014|pisces
1341|You must not be careless today. You must maintain 100 per cent concentration in what you are doing, even if you think you know all the moves by heart. Neptune’s deceptive influence could easily trip you up over the next 24 hours.|10-13-2014|pisces
1342|The best way to solve a relationship issue is not to issue ultimatums but to show a genuine interest in why the object of your affection seems so negative at the moment. Maybe it was something you said. Maybe you just need to un-say it.|10-14-2014|pisces
1343|Why have you been singled out for so much good fortune? Who knows. Who cares. The fact is that both at home and at work others are going out of their way to make life fun for you. Go out of your way to enjoy it.|10-15-2014|pisces
1344|You need to be more flexible when it comes to emotional relationships. With so much cosmic activity in the domestic area of your chart loved ones may be difficult to handle but will respond favorably if you approach them with gentle understanding.|10-16-2014|pisces
1345|You may not be looking forward to a social event of some kind but the planets indicate if you make the effort to enjoy yourself you will be surprised how much fun you have. Go on, get up and dance – you know you want to.|10-17-2014|pisces
1346|It does not matter in the slightest what others think about you and what you are doing. If they want to be critical, that’s up to them but you don’t have to listen, or care. Be who you want to be and do what you want to do.|10-19-2014|pisces
1347|You are in a practical frame of mind at the moment and that’s good because there are a number of everyday issues that need to be dealt with. Focus especially on money matters over the next 24 hours and remember: cash is king.|10-20-2014|pisces
1348|Pluto in your opposite sign of Capricorn may seem to be undermining friendships and relationships but what it is really doing is testing how strong they are. What happens over the remainder of the week will make clear who you can trust, and love.|10-21-2014|pisces
1349|So many things in your life need to change and tomorrow’s eclipse means this is the time to gets serious about them. Creatively and romantically you need to identify your highest ideals and accept nothing less than perfection.|10-22-2014|pisces
1350|No matter how difficult the past few weeks have been – and there were times when you could have screamed – what comes next will restore your faith in yourself, if not yet the whole of humanity. Today’s solar eclipse will in some way delight you.|10-23-2014|pisces
1351|It’s not often you need to be told to keep your feet on the ground but with so much fantastic cosmic activity taking place it will be easy to get carried away. Enjoy the good things that come your way, but never take them for granted.|10-24-2014|pisces
1352|As from this weekend relationships will become easier to handle, not least because you are no longer prepared to put up with certain people’s negative behavior. There are times when you need to get tough and this is one of them.|10-25-2014|pisces
1353|As a cardinal sign you like to make quick decisions and you would prefer to make a wrong choice than no choice at all. But not everyone is like you and you may feel a bit frustrated today with someone who just can’t get their act together.|10-26-2014|pisces
1354|If you measure success in terms of winning and losing then, inevitably, you will never be truly satisfied. Real success means being a better person today than you were yesterday or the day before. Make that your yardstick this coming week.|10-27-2014|pisces
1355|The most important thing now is that you simply refuse to settle for the same old way of doing things. Something you see or hear will stimulate your imagination and make you realize there are many ways you can make life more interesting.|10-28-2014|pisces
1356|According to the planets you want to do one thing but your subconscious mind says you should be doing something else. What you end up doing is actually of secondary importance. What matters is that you do something – right now.|10-29-2014|pisces
1357|If you try to limit someone’s freedom today you could find it rebounds on you. Better by far to give them the space they require and the encouragement they crave. It’s unlikely they will wander too far without your approval.|10-30-2014|pisces
1358|What you think is important and what really is important may be easily confused over the next 48 hours, so keep things simple. If you let your mind wander your life could get a lot more complicated than it needs to be.|11-01-2014|pisces
1359|You may be eager to push ahead with a plan of some sort but you won’t get far if you try to go at it alone. Take your time, make alliances and do it right. Thursday’s full moon should remove any obstacles still in your path.|11-02-2014|pisces
1360|You won’t lack for confidence today but common sense may be harder to come by. Make sure you know what you are letting yourself in for before agreeing to part with cash or support a creative project that is under other people’s control. |11-03-2014|pisces
1361|A creative or romantic problem may seem to have no logical answer but only because you are looking at it from a negative angle. Raise your sights and it will quickly become apparent what needs to be done. Then you must do it.|11-04-2014|pisces
1362|Be sensible and stick within your natural limits. It may be tempting to go beyond what you know you are capable of but the planets warn your calculations could easily be wrong – and that could be costly in more ways than one. |11-05-2014|pisces
1363|Be a bit outrageous today. Do something that is guaranteed to shock those who see you as the kind of person who never makes waves. Too many people have been taking you for granted of late. Time to shake them up a bit.|11-07-2014|pisces
1364|If your feelings for a particular individual are not as positive as they appear to believe you will do more harm than good pretending that they are. Honesty is essential today and over the weekend, especially in affairs of the heart.|11-08-2014|pisces
1365|Be generous with someone who isn’t always so generous to you. It will do you good to treat this person well no matter what problems they may have caused you in the past. Forgiveness cures all ills both real and imagined.|11-09-2014|pisces
1366|Today’s Mars-Pluto link in your opposite sign of Capricorn could create a false sense of urgency – you feel if you don’t take action immediately you will miss your chance. That simply isn’t true. Take your time and make your next move the right move.|11-10-2014|pisces
1367|Your instincts may tell you that what you are planning to do will be unpopular with certain people but that is a pretty good reason for doing it. You don’t care about being popular, you care only about being right.  |11-11-2014|pisces
1368|Are you happy with who you are and what you are doing with your life? If so, why are you so concerned what other people think about you? You don’t have to conform to a certain way of living simply because you think it is expected of you.|11-12-2014|pisces
1369|You can quite easily patch up a relationship which, for one reason or another, has turned sour in recent weeks. Make the first approach and you will be heartened to learn that a loved one is as eager to kiss and make up as you.|11-13-2014|pisces
1370|If you approach a work or relationship problem from a predictable angle then you will get a predictable answer. But if you creep up on it you may discover something you had not noticed before – that it’s not really a problem at all.|11-14-2014|pisces
1371|Try to see things from a loved one’s point of view before criticizing what they are doing. Different people have different needs and different aspirations, so focus on your own desires this weekend and try not to be so judgmental. |11-15-2014|pisces
1372|Be honest about what you desire, even if there is little chance of getting it. Some things take time to develop and you certainly won’t change other people’s attitudes overnight, but you can put down a marker for the future.|11-18-2014|pisces
1373|Don’t waste time wishing you were somewhere else or doing something else. The fact is you are exactly where you need to be and you are doing exactly what you are supposed to be doing. So do it some more, only better than before. |11-19-2014|pisces
1374|A little of what you fancy will do you good today, but don’t go overboard and consume too much or you could make yourself sick. This will be a lively and progressive day but you must strike the right balance between giving and taking. |11-20-2014|pisces
1375|If you are not 100 per cent certain what you want out of life at this particular moment in time, you will be come the start of next week. Over the next 48 hours your head and your heart will be in perfect harmony. Be amazing.|11-21-2014|pisces
1376|Your attitude to certain issues has changed so much in recent months and today’s new moon will cause you to question even more of what you believe. That’s good. The more you change the happier you will be in the long-term. |11-22-2014|pisces
1377|You may find it hard to disguise your feelings but why should you want to when they are so loving? Showing you care is not a sign of weakness but of strength – and loved ones need to know you are strong enough to protect them.|11-23-2014|pisces
1378|You have been pushing yourself hard of late and if you start this week the way you finished the last one it won’t be long before you break down in some way. The only pressure you are under is the pressure you put on yourself.  |11-24-2014|pisces
1379|Jupiter, planet of expansion, links with Mars today, urging you to rise above the limits you have imposed on yourself. You can and you will accomplish things over the next few weeks that you had previously only dreamed of doing.|11-25-2014|pisces
1380|You need to find a solution to either a money matter or a relationship issue. The way out of your predicament is obvious really but it will also be costly. Either you act now and pay now or pay an even larger penalty later.|11-26-2014|pisces
1381|You must act immediately on what your instincts are telling you. It does not matter if everyone else seems to be moving in the opposite direction, it matters only that you trust what your inner voice tells you – don’t doubt it.|11-27-2014|pisces
1382|Just because one thing you tried went wrong does not mean you are a failure and anyone who says you are is not a friend and must be cut from your life right away. You will always get another chance, and another after that.|11-28-2014|pisces
1383|There may be moments this weekend when you regret making a commitment of some kind but the fact is you signed up and now you must see it through to the end. Whether you enjoy it or hate it depends largely on the attitude you choose to adopt.|11-29-2014|pisces
1384|Because you are so immersed in everyday matters you don’t seem to realize just how fortunate you are. Take time out of your busy schedule to stand back from trivial issues and see the bigger picture. Your place in that picture is about to get bigger.|11-30-2014|pisces
1385|Something you have long taken for granted now turns out to be not so simple after all. Rather than be annoyed, be inquisitive and dig a little deeper into the situation – what you find could send you on a voyage of discovery. |12-01-2014|pisces
1386|You will be called upon to make a daring decision, a decision that only you can hope to get away with. You have a wealth of good ideas but do you have the drive and the determination to do something with them? Of course you do. |12-02-2014|pisces
1387|You may not feel entirely at home with a certain group of people but what you learn from them today will make other areas of your life so much easier to deal with. You are about to gain a new perspective on an old problem.|12-03-2014|pisces
1388|There is only one thing worse than allowing yourself to be anxious about a money matter and that is going right the other way and pretending there is nothing wrong at all. A sensible balance is needed if you are to find a lasting solution.|12-04-2014|pisces
1389|You seem to be on the defensive at the moment and that’s probably no bad thing. Most likely no one is out to get you but it will pay you to be cautious anyway. Your instincts could be trying to tell you something.|12-05-2014|pisces
1390|Don’t let doubt creep in this weekend or it will quickly take control. A full moon in the most sensitive area of your chart makes you easily upset by criticism, so resolve right now to let none of it through your protective Cancerian shell.|12-06-2014|pisces
1391|How important are the material things? How much money is enough? These are the sort of questions you will be asking as the new week begins and you may come up with several wrong answers before the right one comes along. Be patient.|12-07-2014|pisces
1392|Something shiny and new will catch your eye today and you won’t be happy until you possess it. Whether or not you can afford it won’t worry you in the slightest, as least not right now. Will you regret it tomorrow? Who cares! |12-08-2014|pisces
1393|Don’t scatter your energy in too many directions today or you may fail to reach your number one goal. And that would be a shame because there is so much you can accomplish and so many lives you can change in beneficial ways. |12-09-2014|pisces
1394|As Venus moves into your opposite sign of Capricorn today you will find it easier to be more outgoing and sociable and that’s good because you have been a bit too self-obsessed of late. You’re allowed to have fun – and look for love! |12-10-2014|pisces
1395|There is a possibility that you will come into money over the next few days – and a possibility that you will spend it all in record quick time! Mars in the wealth area of your chart warns that others won’t be pleased by your extravagance.|12-11-2014|pisces
1396|Sometimes you can be too trusting for your own good and the planets warn if you believe what a work colleague tells today it will cost you in some way. Either they are deceiving you or someone else is deceiving both of you.|12-12-2014|pisces
1397|There is a task you would like to forget about but the powers that be won’t let you, so you might as well get on with it and get it over with. Make a god job of it though or they may make you do it all over again!|12-13-2014|pisces
1398|If someone tries to force you to do things you don’t want to do it may be because you have given them the impression you don’t mind taking orders. Now you will have to do something extreme to let them know it isn’t true.|12-14-2014|pisces
1399|You need to face up to your problems and you need to let certain people know that you will no longer be their whipping boy. But don’t just say it – do something positive that makes them believe that this time you mean it. |12-15-2014|pisces
1400|This could be a lucky day for you, especially if you are prepared to overcome your own cautious nature and take a risk of some kind. Don’t let anyone tell you that something cannot be done: where there is a will there is always a way. |12-16-2014|pisces
1401|There is no point starting a fight you know you cannot win. For some strange reason you feel you must prove yourself to the world, but that simply is not true. Besides, what does it prove if you end up flat on your back? |12-18-2014|pisces
1402|You will be rather impulsive today and if you make it through to the weekend without some kind of emotional drama you will be very lucky indeed. Or maybe you’re the kind of Cancerian who thrives on a bit of drama now and again?|12-19-2014|pisces
1403|If you make an effort to be pleasant over the next 48 hours and you will benefit in ways you had not expected until well into the new year. Others may be difficult to deal with at times but you don’t have to be like them.  |12-20-2014|pisces
1404|Give up the struggle and do what partners and colleagues want you to do. That may sound like an unacceptable loss of freedom but the planets indicate that it will actually be a lot of fun. You don’t have to be in control all the time.|12-21-2014|pisces
1405|This promises to be an interesting time and many strange things are likely to happen over the next few days. Chances are you will meet people who challenge your worldview and encourage you to look at life in new and exciting ways. |12-22-2014|pisces
1406|If someone tries to interfere in your personal affairs over the next 24 hours you must let them know in no uncertain terms that you’re not having it. Sometimes you have to act tough right from the start and this is one of those times. |12-23-2014|pisces
1407|According to the planets someone will try to pressure you into justifying what you are doing but there is no reason at all why you should play their game. Do what feels right to you and, if others don’t like it, that’s just too bad. |12-24-2014|pisces
1408|Put your own needs first today and ignore those who say you are being selfish. It’s about time certain people were made to realize that you do not exist simply to make life easier for them. It’s not you who is being selfish.|12-25-2014|pisces
1409|It may be obvious that a friend or relative is keeping something from you but there is a very good reason for it. This is one of those occasions when it really is better that you don’t know what is going on. It will keep you from worrying. |12-26-2014|pisces
1410|This is a great time for partnerships, be they personal or professional in nature. With both the Sun and Venus moving through your opposite sign you will find it easy to persuade just about anyone to do your bidding. Take advantage of it! |12-27-2014|pisces
1411|Partners and loved ones are determined to prove their worth, so by all means sit back and let them do the bulk of the work. Let them know you trust them and in return they will find ways to make your life more enjoyable.|12-28-2014|pisces
1412|Be careful what you say today because if you are not absolutely clear about your meaning someone could take your words the wrong way and cause a scene. Polish up your communication skills – you are going to need them this week.|12-29-2014|pisces
1413|Try not to get obsessive about something that is clearly unattainable or you could face all sorts of problems come Thursday when Mars opposes Jupiter across the financial axis of your chart. Not everything that has value deserves to be valued.|12-30-2014|pisces
1414|According to the planets you could easily be panicked into making a move that could be disastrous on all levels. Just because the year is coming to an end does not mean you have to speed things up and take instant decisions. Calm down.|12-31-2014|pisces
1415|This is potentially one of the most exciting times ever and if you find that hard to believe right now, don’t worry – what happens over the next few days will surely convince you. A new year, a new challenge and, maybe, a new you too. |01-01-2015|pisces
1416|This could be a challenging day for a relationship of some sort and you will have to call on your powers of self-control not to get too emotional. Someone needs to keep a clear head – and that someone will have to be you. |01-02-2015|pisces
1417|You seem to be coming in for a lot of criticism of late but don’t worry about it. Some people go out of their way to find fault for no better reason than they resent your popularity and success. Give them something more to resent this weekend. |01-03-2015|pisces
1418|Because tomorrow’s full moon takes place in your birth sign you could get a bit emotional. Looking back from the middle of the week you will wonder what came over you, but even a Cancer loses it once in a while.|01-04-2015|pisces
1419|A full moon in your birth sign means it’s unlikely you will be feeling your best today but that’s okay because friends and family will go out of their way to cheer you up. There really is no reason why you should be depressed. |01-05-2015|pisces
1420|You need to stay on your toes both physically and mentally, because unexpected events will test you to the limit. The good news is that one of those events will bring with it a golden opportunity, the kind that comes around all too rarely.|01-06-2015|pisces
1421|You may feel super confident at the moment but the planets warn you should think long and hard before taking on someone in a position of power. If you feel the need to prove yourself wait until Mars changes signs on the 12th. |01-07-2015|pisces
1422|Start planning your next major career move. The planets indicate that you know what you want and you know how to get it, so move fast and impress people in positions of authority. It won’t be long before you are on the rise.|01-08-2015|pisces
1423|You want to make a good impression on employers and people in positions of authority but you also want to tell the truth – and you may not be able to do both. Be honest today, both with others and with yourself. |01-09-2015|pisces
1424|You may spend a bit too much money this weekend but it’s no big deal. Jupiter, planet of extravagance but also of luck, will bring new opportunities to boost your bank balance. Go on, splash out – you know you want to.|01-10-2015|pisces
1425|Don’t waste time chasing after something you cannot have and which you secretly suspect may not be good for you even if you did manage to get it. Apply your intensity and intelligence to something more deserving of your attention. |01-11-2015|pisces
1426|You want to do something out of the ordinary, something different, something amazing, something outrageous. Only you can decide what that something is going to be but the planets indicate it will be fun, and change your life for the better.|01-12-2015|pisces
1427|Don’t worry if you find yourself moving in the opposite direction to everyone else today because no harm will come of it. Most likely it is they who have got it wrong and you who will be proved right in the long-term. Then you can gloat. |01-13-2015|pisces
1428|Today’s positive cosmic influences suggest you can ask for almost anything you want and partners and loved ones will hand it over with no questions asked. Make the most of it – you know from experience that this kind of luck rarely lasts. |01-14-2015|pisces
1429|You may be short of cash at the moment but you can still find ways to get what you want. Cancer is nothing if not resourceful and if you cannot satisfy your needs one way you will satisfy them another – and it won’t cost you a cent. |01-15-2015|pisces
1430|A few days from now you will look back and wonder why and how you allowed yourself to get so worked up about a relationship matter. Don’t dwell on it though – life always moves on and so should you.|01-16-2015|pisces
1431|You will go out of your way to help someone this weekend, both because you feel it is the right thing to do and because you think you may benefit in some way. If you help them now they will help you even more later on.|01-17-2015|pisces
1432|When the Sun moves into your fellow Air sign of Aquarius on Tuesday you will find that so many of the things you have been worrying about no longer matter. Actually it’s doubtful if they mattered in the first place.|01-18-2015|pisces
1433|If facts and figures don’t add up then you must investigate the matter. Yes, you may annoy a few people but as it’s your reputation and your money that is at stake you cannot afford to take chances. Get to the bottom of it.|01-19-2015|pisces
1434|Work and money matters will be top of your agenda today and for the rest of the week and the planets indicate if you work hard now you will make a name for yourself and make a handsome profit before the end of the month.|01-20-2015|pisces
1435|Something you had high hopes for seems to have come to nothing and, of course, you are disappointed. But don’t dwell on it too long because there are so many other interesting things you could be doing. Don’t waste tears on yesterday’s news. |01-21-2015|pisces
1436|Don’t worry if you fall behind in your schedule today because you will catch up with ease tomorrow when Saturn compels you to act. It’s nice to be on top of your workload but it’s no big deal if you waste time occasionally.|01-22-2015|pisces
1437|Make forgive and forget your motto today. According to the planets it simply is not worth your while continuing some kind of feud – in fact everyone concerned would be delighted if you were to pretend that nothing ever happened.|01-23-2015|pisces
1438|The only danger this weekend is that you could rush into something you are not prepared for, simply because you fear that if you don’t get in first you will somehow miss out. That’s nonsense. Take your time and get it right. |01-24-2015|pisces
1439|You will have to put your nose to the grindstone if you are to reach your goals over the next few days. However, as Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your fellow Water sign of Pisces on Tuesday you’ll find ways to relax as well. |01-25-2015|pisces
1440|This is potentially an excellent time for you but you find that hard to believe. Why? Because Mercury is playing tricks on your mind. Don’t worry, a few days from now something remarkable, and most welcome, is going to happen. |01-26-2015|pisces
1441|It may seem as if your fate is in the hands of other people, and maybe it is, but that is no reason to worry. On the contrary, if you let partners take the big decisions today you will benefit both professionally and financially.|01-27-2015|pisces
1442|Keep your eyes and ears open today because something you see or hear could be the final piece in a puzzle that has been causing you sleepless nights. No doubt you will kick yourself mentally when you realize how simple it was. |01-28-2015|pisces
1443|You need to get tough today, firstly with yourself for being far too wasteful of late, then with those who seem to believe that you exist only to make life easier for them. Looks like they will be on a steep learning curve. |01-29-2015|pisces
1444|Mars and Pluto are nicely aligned today and you could not wish for a better influence to get things done. It is, of course, up to you what you choose to do with your time and your energy but whatever it is you must do it BIG.|01-30-2015|pisces
1445|Venus in your fellow Water sign of Pisces makes it so much easier to get along with people, even those you don’t like for one reason or another. Even if you fall out with someone this weekend you will very soon be friends again.|01-31-2015|pisces
1446|There is a chance you will come into money over the next few days, maybe through sheer good fortune or maybe because an investment has paid off at last. Whatever the reason don’t let anyone tell you that you do not deserve it – you do. |02-01-2015|pisces
1447|If you make an effort to help someone in need today it will make both them and you feel better. But why help one person when, by joining some kind of charitable or progressive movement, you could help thousands, or even millions?|02-02-2015|pisces
1448|You may be tempted to take some kind of risk today but as there is a full moon in the area of your chart that governs your wealth that may not be a good idea. Do you know all the facts? If not it could prove costly.|02-03-2015|pisces
1449|Try one or two things you would not normally attempt today. The results could be spectacular. Of course, the results could also be spectacularly disappointing but that is a risk worth taking and really not much of a risk at all.|02-04-2015|pisces
1450|You cannot be expected to make an unbiased decision about something where your own interests are at stake. Either do what is best for yourself or ask a neutral third party to adjudicate on what should be done. |02-05-2015|pisces
1451|Under no circumstances commit yourself to anything of a business or financial nature today. If others try to pressure you into signing on the dotted line that is a sure sign you should wait. There’s no rush, at least not for you. |02-06-2015|pisces
1452|With Venus moving through one of the most open and outgoing areas of your chart this weekend you must not limit yourself to your home or your office. Get out into the world. Discover new places and meet new people.|02-07-2015|pisces
1453|Don’t be afraid to try something new this week. If you take an original approach to a familiar problem you will be amazed how quickly you find a solution. That applies especially to money and business matters. You could make a fortune. |02-08-2015|pisces
1454|Try not to let worries and fears get the better of you today. Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart means you must consciously and continually strive to stay cheerful. Go on, give it a try – it’s really not that hard. |02-09-2015|pisces
1455|No matter what negative things may happen today or tomorrow you must laugh at them long and loud. This is one of those days when, if you look on the dark side, you will only make matters worse. Think yourself happy.|02-10-2015|pisces
1456|Now that Mercury, planet of the mind, is moving in your favor again you won’t have much trouble working out what needs to be done. The most pressing thing, of course, is to get your financial affairs in some sort of order.|02-11-2015|pisces
1457|If a friend or colleague tries to take liberties with your kindly nature today you must let them know it isn’t going to happen. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your career. Don’t do other people’s work as well as your own. |02-12-2015|pisces
1458|Don’t give up on something just because it does not seem to be working out the way you intended. That applies doubly if you have spent a lot of money on it. Give it time and you will eventually see a return on your investment.|02-13-2015|pisces
1459|Don’t attach too much importance to material things over the next 48 hours or you could get rather emotional when something you value is taken away from you. Real security depends not on what you possess but on your inner strength.|02-14-2015|pisces
1460|Travel and social activities will be top of your agenda this week, so don’t tie yourself down to anything that could stop you getting out and about. Your mind will also be open to new ideas, some of them a bit outrageous! |02-15-2015|pisces
1461|What happens today and tomorrow could be rather challenging. People you deal with on a one-to-one basis will try to impose their will on you and the only way to stop them is to stand up for yourself. They will admire your courage. |02-16-2015|pisces
1462|Ignore your critics and get on with what you know you should be doing. The only mistake you made was letting them know what you were planning. Next time keep it to yourself. You can live without their feedback. |02-17-2015|pisces
1463|Do you keep quiet about an issue you have strong opinions about, just so you can keep things calm and not hurt other people’s feelings? No you do not. Speak up and let the world know what you believe. You don’t have to play nice. |02-18-2015|pisces
1464|The planets suggest you will say something shocking today, just for the fun of it. It may be amusing to you but others won’t be so happy about it and your reputation could suffer as a result. Seriously, does it need to be said?|02-19-2015|pisces
1465|You could easily lose patience with someone on the work front today, but if you are smart you will hold back from saying anything too negative. They could make things tough for you later if they decide they don’t like your attitude.|02-20-2015|pisces
1466|Try to remember that you are negotiating from a position of strength and that others will have to make concessions to you – not the other way round. Sometimes you can be far too soft for your own good. Strike a hard bargain. |02-21-2015|pisces
1467|You can work alone during the early part of the week if you want to but later on you must join forces with those who share your aims and ambitions. If you feel restless then by all means go off and do something completely different. |02-22-2015|pisces
1468|If someone you live or work with needs assistance today, and according to the planets they most likely will, you will go out of your way to help them. But let them know you cannot possibly ride to the rescue each and every time.|02-23-2015|pisces
1469|You won’t be in one of your more sociable moods today but that’s okay because you need time to yourself to plan your next move. Don’t let practical considerations make you give up on a long-term ambition. It CAN be done if you desire it enough|02-24-2015|pisces
1470|You want to be on the move today. Most of all you want to get away from your usual environment and do something different. But don’t make it anything too energetic – if you can’t do it sitting down it’s most likely not for you! |02-25-2015|pisces
1471|No matter how annoyed you may be with a particular person your sixth sense should be telling you this is not the time to put your feelings into words. Bide your time and hit back only when you have more evidence to make your case.|02-26-2015|pisces
1472|No one is perfect, not even a Cancer, and if you accept that fact you won’t waste valuable time worrying that you failed to live up to expectations. The only reason you feel down is because you judge yourself too harshly.|02-27-2015|pisces
1473|Push ahead with your plans and show employers and other important people that you must be taken seriously. Work for yourself this weekend rather than for other people. Everything you do must be geared towards your own long-term ambitions.|02-28-2015|pisces
1474|You have energy and enthusiasm to spare and that’s good because someone you work or do business with will need your help over the next few days. If you assist them now you will be in their good books for a long time to come. |03-01-2015|pisces
1475|Something you value will go out of your life today and, of course, you will be a little sad. But you know that you need to make room for the even better things that will be coming your way very soon. This is no time for sentiment. |03-02-2015|pisces
1476|If anyone tries to push you around or force you in a direction you don’t want to go they will soon learn the error of their ways. You are in no mood to take nonsense from anyone and if others can’t read the warning signals, well, watch out!|03-03-2015|pisces
1477|Make an effort to get out and about and meet as wide a range of people as possible. You may not like everyone you encounter but each and every one of them will have something worth hearing, something you can turn to your advantage.|03-04-2015|pisces
1478|Don’t waste precious time and energy on petty arguments today because you should be channeling everything you have got in productive directions. What you do over the next few days will set the scene for the next few months – so make it big.|03-05-2015|pisces
1479|Do you follow your instincts or do you follow your friends? That is the question you must answer today and it must be one thing or the other. First, of course, you need to decide what means the most to you: ambition or popularity.|03-06-2015|pisces
1480|It seems you are having second thoughts about an opinion you once took for granted, and that’s good because this is the right time of year to ask questions of the “what’s it all about” variety. Who knows, you may even find the answer.|03-07-2015|pisces
1481|Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart means you will be thinking seriously about what you do for a living over the next few days. Could it be time for a change of direction? Yes, it could, so go all the way.|03-08-2015|pisces
1482|One of the most challenging times of the year will begin when the Sun changes signs on the 20th but between now and then there are plenty of things you can do to make life easier for yourself. For a start, stop worrying about your career. |03-09-2015|pisces
1483|With Mars and Jupiter perfectly aligned today success is a foregone conclusion. No matter how many times you have failed or been rebuffed in the past you will get what you want now – and the more you want the more you will get.|03-10-2015|pisces
1484|Your mind is a powerful tool and if you think positive thoughts today and for the rest of the week there is no doubt that positive things will occur. No matter what happens in the world around you strive to rise above it with a smile.|03-11-2015|pisces
1485|It appears you have finally realized that you have been wasting a lot of time and a lot of energy on something that is not worth the effort. That something will fade in importance over the next few days. Soon you will have forgotten it ever existed.|03-12-2015|pisces
1486|You have some very strong opinions about certain issues and what happens today will confirm that they are spot on. But don’t use that as an excuse not to look at new ideas, because life never stands still and neither should you. |03-13-2015|pisces
1487|You can, if you wish, put off finishing a project that is beginning to bore you, but deep down you know you should press on and complete it. You have come so far and done so much – don’t waste all that time and effort now.|03-14-2015|pisces
1488|There may be times over the next few days when it seems you have bitten off more than you can chew and you consider backing away from certain commitments. Get over that idea straight away A promise is a promise – don’t let others down.|03-15-2015|pisces
1489|It is quite possible you could come into money this week but it is also possible that you will lose money. Jupiter, planet of luck but also extravagance, warns you need to stay on top of the wasteful side of your nature. |03-16-2015|pisces
1490|You will have no trouble asserting yourself today but with Venus, planet of harmony, moving into the friendship area of your chart why bother being assertive when you can charm your way to success? Everyone wants to be on your side.|03-17-2015|pisces
1491|Decide what your number one priority is going to be and stick to it come what may. The planets warn you could easily find yourself talked into doing things today that don’t do you any favors at all, so be tough with yourself.|03-18-2015|pisces
1492|There is no need to go to extremes today, even though certain individuals may be urging you to do just that. In all areas of your life, but especially where business and finances are concerned, you must avoid excessive behavior. |03-19-2015|pisces
1493|The Sun moves into the area of your chart that governs your social and professional status today. What it means is that over the next few weeks you will get many opportunities to better yourself – and you must not be slow in taking them.|03-20-2015|pisces
1494|This is an important weekend for you and by the end of it you will have made some serious decisions concerning your career or vocation. But it does not have to be about serious things completely – you’re allowed to have fun as well. |03-21-2015|pisces
1495|The bigger the problem the more you like it as it gives you a chance to show your brainpower. In fact it is quite likely that you will spend a large part of the day solving other people’s dilemmas for them. You will certainly be in demand. |03-22-2015|pisces
1496|Try not to be too aggressive today, even if you think it is justified. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to money-related matters. In a nutshell: don’t upset people whose support you may need in the near future. |03-23-2015|pisces
1497|You can no longer rely on other people to come to your rescue if you go too far. The only reason you got away with so much recently is because others were there to catch you when you fell. Now the safety net has gone.|03-24-2015|pisces
1498|As Saturn links with the Sun today your natural caution will work in your favor, especially on the work front. While others are bigging it up and throwing their money around you will be quietly making plans to secure your own position.|03-25-2015|pisces
1499|This is a good day to chat with friends and plan social outings of one sort or another. But don’t take up too many invitations between now and the weekend – you won’t be popular if you have to cancel some of them.|03-26-2015|pisces
1500|Don’t let those who say you are behaving in an illogical manner persuade you to change your ways. What you are doing may look silly to them but from your point of view it makes sense – and it is your point of view that matters.|03-27-2015|pisces
1501|As Jupiter is moving retrograde in the financial area of your chart you should cut back on luxuries and make sure you get value for money in everything you buy. Your luck will turn later but for now every cent must be made to count.|03-28-2015|pisces
1502|You may not be in the most sociable of moods at the moment but that’s okay because the more time you spend thinking and planning the better. Others can party if they want to – you have better things to do with your energy. |03-29-2015|pisces
1503|It isn’t enough that you just feel confident, you must apply that confidence and get important things done. Both in your personal life and at work there are changes that need to be made. Make them now while you are in the mood. |03-30-2015|pisces
1504|It may seem as if you can get away with anything now, and maybe you can, but later in the month you won’t be so lucky, so look ahead, think ahead and, if you are ahead, make sure you stay ahead. Cancer is supposed to be cautious. |03-31-2015|pisces
1505|There is a huge luck factor working in your favor now and if you are smart you will milk it for all it is worth. Don’t worry that you might not deserve some of the good things you get – the universe says it’s your turn to benefit.|04-01-2015|pisces
1506|Something unexpected will happen today, something that comes at you out of the blue. It may be annoying if it disrupts your plans but you won’t be negative about it for long: how could you when it makes life so much more enjoyable?|04-02-2015|pisces
1507|You’ve had your fill of emotional ups and downs of late but once tomorrow’s lunar eclipse has passed a more positive phase will begin. At last you can stop worrying about other people’s problems and do something about your own.|04-03-2015|pisces
1508|You will find it difficult to control your emotions this weekend and someone is sure to say or do something that makes your blood boil. The eclipse not only distorts your feelings but makes it difficult to know what is really going on, so take care.|04-04-2015|pisces
1509|You are so close to success – all you have to do is keep doing what you are doing and within a matter of days you will make the breakthrough you have been dreaming of. Soon you will be the person everyone wants to know! |04-05-2015|pisces
1510|If you want to impress employers and other important people then now is the time. Don’t hide yourself away: show them, and the world in general, what you are capable of. Self-confidence plus ambition is a surefire recipe for success.|04-06-2015|pisces
1511|You will be tempted to place your trust in a stranger who says the right things, but that does not mean you are doing the right thing. Are things so bad that you have to confide in someone you know nothing about? Trust yourself for a change.|04-07-2015|pisces
1512|The decisions you make today will either come back to help you or come back to haunt you later in the month, so make sure they are good decisions and make sure you know what you are letting yourself in for emotionally and financially.|04-08-2015|pisces
1513|You will have to deal with a difficult person today and although it might be a pain you are advised not to say or do anything that could turn them against you. According to the planets you will need this person’s assistance very soon.|04-10-2015|pisces
1514|You worry too much. The planets suggest that what you have been getting so worked up about in recent weeks is not worth the heartbreak, so pull your attention away from it and focus only on things that make you smile.|04-11-2015|pisces
1515|If someone tries to take liberties with your generous nature this week you must come down on them hard. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your career. Under no circumstances take on other people’s work.|04-12-2015|pisces
1516|Try not to be too cynical about what is going on around you. Some people can be so negative in the way they look at the world but there is no reason why you should join them. If you think positive you can make positive things happen. |04-13-2015|pisces
1517|There may be a crisis of some sort over the next 24 hours but your confidence is sky high at the moment so chances are you will find a solution. Others will turn to you when their lives go into freefall. Somehow you know what to do.|04-14-2015|pisces
1518|This could be and should be a special time for you. Like all Cancerians you want to do things for other people, to make the world a better place in some way or other, and your chance to do so will arrive very soon.|04-15-2015|pisces
1519|People come to you with their problems all the time, which is nice in a way, but unless you want the entire day to be taken up listening to sob stories you will need to draw a line. You’re entitled to some privacy.|04-17-2015|pisces
1520|A new moon in the career area of your chart means you will be focusing on work plans over the next 48 hours. Others may say you should not be so serious about life but only because they are nowhere near as ambitious as you.|04-18-2015|pisces
1521|You cannot do it all by yourself, so don’t even try. If you need help during the early part of the week, and you will, you must ask for it. You will be surprised how quickly friends and colleagues rally to your cause.|04-19-2015|pisces
1522|Don’t worry too much about trying to impress other people, just get on with your life and do what feels right. With the Sun firmly on your side again you will get all the approval you could wish for over the next few days.|04-20-2015|pisces
1523|One of the most trying periods of the year has come to an end and you managed to survive! You may be in the mood to celebrate but don’t go over the top. The planets warn you need to stay out of trouble today.|04-21-2015|pisces
1524|You have every right to believe what you believe and you must make sure others know that. You must also let them know that you have no intention of changing your viewpoint. Why should you when you are so obviously right?|04-22-2015|pisces
1525|Someone who is usually very open with you will be secretive for no good reason today, but don’t take it to heart because it is unlikely to have anything to do with you personally. They will be their usual bubbly self again come the weekend.|04-23-2015|pisces
1526|You will find yourself up against a stubborn opponent today and you may have to accept that you are not going to shift them. Fortunately, the world is a big enough place for both of you – so long as you are on different continents!|04-24-2015|pisces
1527|If there is any doubt that you won’t be able to honor a s this weekend you must let others know as early as possible. They won’t be happy with you, of course, but at least you will have given them time to make other arrangements. |04-25-2015|pisces
1528|Don’t worry if you go too far and say too much over the next few days. Later in the week you will come to your senses and offer your sincere apologies, which others will accept, but in future they won’t be so eager to annoy you. |04-26-2015|pisces
1529|You will find yourself up against someone who is every bit as immovable as you, so the best you can hope for is a stalemate. Don’t waste your time and energy on battles like this that cannot be won – focus on the ones where you have the advantage.|04-27-2015|pisces
1530|Try not to worry what others might think of you. If certain people disapprove of what you are doing you should take that as a sign that you are doing the right thing. In fact, the more you shock them the better!|04-28-2015|pisces
1531|You don’t lack for ideas or the confidence to use them but you should nevertheless keep them to yourself for a bit. The planets warn this is not a good time to share what you know, not even with like-minded people. Bide your time.|04-29-2015|pisces
1532|No matter what happens today you must remember at all times and in all situations that you are not a victim. You alone control your destiny and you alone have the power to change things for the better. Be positive at every turn.|04-30-2015|pisces
1533|There are times when you are quite unsociable and this is one of them. By all means spend some time by yourself to think things through and decide what your next major move is going to be. Success is more likely if you plan well ahead. |05-01-2015|pisces
1534|Chances are you will come to the conclusion that a certain person cannot be trusted or relied on and therefore it is pointless trying to get along with them. Your frustration is understandable but your reasoning is wrong. Take another look.|05-02-2015|pisces
1535|You will make a big impression over the next few days, but will it be a positive one? Don’t feel guilty if you lose your temper with someone but if you do go over the top make sure you apologize the moment you calm down. |05-03-2015|pisces
1536|The best way to make the most of the Sun in one of the most positive areas of your chart is to believe that all things are possible. Do what your heart tells you is right today, even if everyone else seems to think it is wrong. |05-04-2015|pisces
1537|You know what you want and you know where to get it, so why do you hesitate? Maybe it’s because you fear you don’t have the right to just take it. Maybe you don’t but you know what they say: possession is nine-tenths of the law.|05-05-2015|pisces
1538|Be brutally honest today, both with yourself and with other people. The fact is you don’t really care what others think, you care only for the truth, and what you discover over the next 24 hours will affect you profoundly.|05-06-2015|pisces
1539|You have nothing to worry about and everything to look forward to, so stop being so fearful and get out there into the world. The planets indicate if you think lucky you will be lucky – so what have you got to lose?|05-07-2015|pisces
1540|There seems to be quite a bit of tension in the air at the moment and if you are involved in matters of a joint nature it will pay you to tone down your views and opinions a bit. But only a bit – don’t give in altogether.|05-08-2015|pisces
1541|Once again you are worrying about things over which you have no control and it’s a complete waste of time. Yes, certain developments may be unsettling but it’s not the end of the world, so lighten up. Life is still wonderful. |05-09-2015|pisces
1542|There are so many things you want to change but the most important thing that needs changing is your own way of looking at life. Do a bit of self-analysis this week and get rid of beliefs and habits which have outlived their usefulness. |05-10-2015|pisces
1543|If you do a good deed or make some kind of sacrifice for a friend or relative over the next 24 hours you are sure to receive a reward or compensation. The best reward of all, however, is to know that you are appreciated. |05-11-2015|pisces
1544|You will have to do something today that takes up a lot of your time but you know if you leave it to other people they will mess it up completely. Try to convince yourself it’s what you really want to do, even though it’s not.|05-12-2015|pisces
