0|What is your fondest dream? What is it you would give up everything to do if the opportunity came your way? Well, get ready because the approaching new moon suggests you will soon get the chance. Make your dream a reality.|12-01-2013|aquarius
1|Just because something is new-fangled or fashionable does not mean it is good. Keep that thought in mind and if you are confronted with a choice between something old and dull and something new and exciting, go for the old and dull.|12-02-2013|aquarius
2|Some people react well to criticism and some people don’t and the planets warn you need to watch what you say over the next 24 hours. Not everyone appreciates your directness and honesty, especially when it hurts them personally.|12-03-2013|aquarius
3|You are advised not to make any hasty decisions today. You may believe you know all the facts but the planets warn there is one little thing you have overlooked – and that one little thing could have very big consequences.|12-04-2013|aquarius
4|Friendships and social activities are under excellent stars at the moment but don’t sit there waiting for other people to make things happen – get out into the world and make them happen yourself. A sense of adventure will take you a long way.  |12-05-2013|aquarius
5|There is no point complaining about a certain person’s behavior when what they are doing now is what they did yesterday and the day before that. It’s obviously in their nature, so either accept it or move away from their influence. |12-06-2013|aquarius
6|It may be easy to feel sorry for someone who has fallen on hard times but the fact is it’s largely their own fault, so don’t shed too many tears. Help them find a solution by all means but don’t let your own guilt feelings kick in.|12-07-2013|aquarius
7|Whatever else you do this week do NOT give in to emotional blackmail. If others get the impression that you are easily swayed they won’t leave you alone for a moment. Get tough with them early and the next few days will be fine. |12-08-2013|aquarius
8|Try not to get excited about something that is not important today or you may miss out on something that is. There are so many distractions in your life at the moment that your brain cannot possibly keep track of them all.|12-09-2013|aquarius
9|You need to bring your plans up to date. Sit down with a pen and a piece of paper and write down your top three objectives. Then map out how you are going to get from where you are now to where you want to be. Then do it.|12-10-2013|aquarius
10|Whatever it is you hear today you must make an effort to read between the lines, because what is not being said is likely to be ten times more important than what is being said. Watch other people’s body language – it will tell you a lot.|12-11-2013|aquarius
11|You will have to work twice as hard today to catch up with the things you should have done yesterday. However, if you knuckle down and apply yourself you may actually get ahead – and get a big reward for your efforts tomorrow.|12-12-2013|aquarius
12|You will have to accept that you won’t get things all your own way, especially at work where certain individuals seem to take a delight in being unreasonable. The good news is it’s only a passing phase, so don’t blow your top.|12-13-2013|aquarius
13|The cosmic omens are all in your favor this weekend and the more pressure you are under the more you will accomplish. Think big, act big and don’t let other people’s small-minded ways stop you from making your mark on the world.|12-14-2013|aquarius
14|This week’s full moon will have people doing all sorts of weird and wonderful things, but if you can keep your feelings in check and think logically about what happens you will be in a position to take advantage of the situation|12-15-2013|aquarius
15|The answers you seek are not that hard to find but you will surely find them quicker today if you get some assistance. And don’t make things too complicated for yourself – the simplest answers are nearly always the best.|12-16-2013|aquarius
16|Today’s full moon indicates that your differences with a certain person are too wide and too strong to pretend that they do not exist. If a parting of the ways is necessary so be it. In the long-term you will both be better off for it.|12-17-2013|aquarius
17|Delays of one sort or another are likely over the next 24 hours but while it may be frustrating it could also inspire you to try a different route. Ultimately all roads lead to the same destination, so stop complaining and get on with it.|12-18-2013|aquarius
18|Spend as much time as you can with your friends today because you may not get so many opportunities to be sociable in the days and weeks to follow. Don’t expect anything of them, or of yourself – just go out and have fun together.|12-19-2013|aquarius
19|A minor dispute could easily get out of hand today, especially if you insist that you are in the right and everyone else is wrong. You’re not the only one who is stubborn, so a standoff is likely. Someone needs to back down.|12-20-2013|aquarius
20|On one level you will be the life and soul of the party this weekend, but on another your focus will turn inward and you will start asking yourself the kind of questions that no amount of partying can answer. It’s time to get serious.|12-21-2013|aquarius
21|Do what you can for other people this week, especially those who are in some way less fortunate than you. No matter what your own problems may be there are millions, maybe billions, who would happily trade places with you.|12-22-2013|aquarius
22|Keep your thoughts to yourself as the new week begins, even if you are the sort of Aquarius who enjoys discussing your ideas and beliefs with other people. The universe is trying to send you a message, so be quiet and listen.|12-23-2013|aquarius
23|What happens today will convince you that life is good and about to get even better. The only reason your thoughts have been so negative of late is because you have allowed your emotions to blot out common sense. Time to rebalance. |12-24-2013|aquarius
24|The harder you try to figure something out the more of a headache it gives you. So stop trying. Some things don’t have an easy answer. Some things don’t have an answer at all. In the greater scheme of things does it really matter? No!|12-25-2013|aquarius
25|If your present approach to a personal or professional problem is not working then clearly you need to tackle it from a different angle. Some people say you are too inflexible, too set in your ways to change. Prove them wrong.|12-26-2013|aquarius
26|If someone comes to you for assistance you will go out of your way to help them. But don’t go so far that you spend all your time and energy on their problems and none on your own. And watch how much money you spend too.|12-27-2013|aquarius
27|You may not be enthusiastic about a task you are being asked to perform but you need to buck up your ideas because if you go into it with a negative attitude the results will be less than pleasing. Treat it as a game – after all, that’s what life is.|12-28-2013|aquarius
28|The new year is almost here and everyone is singing and dancing but make sure you set aside a few private moments for yourself. Thinking is important to you but if there is a party going on at full volume you won’t get much done.|12-29-2013|aquarius
29|If a friend wants to wallow in self-pity today then let them get on with it. No matter what you say to cheer them up they are in no mood to listen, so don’t waste your breath. Maybe, perversely, it’s what makes them feel good.|12-30-2013|aquarius
30|You will be easily provoked today, especially if you think someone is taking liberties at your expense. The only danger is you may get the wrong end of the stick and react to a provocation that exists nowhere but in your own mind. |12-31-2013|aquarius
31|Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart will bring challenges of an emotional nature. Don’t be afraid to let others know how you feel, even if you have to raise your voice, because only then will they take you seriously.|01-01-2014|aquarius
32|Take care not to say too much when talking to people you are not sure you can trust. You like to natter, it’s part of your nature, but if you say too much you could  undermine your own position. Don’t forget: knowledge is power.|01-02-2014|aquarius
33|For some reason you appear to believe that you are surrounded by enemies, that the whole wide world is against you. Stop the foolish imaginings and look on the bright side for a change. Life is what you choose to make of it.|01-03-2014|aquarius
34|For some strange reason you have a tendency at the moment to see the worst in every situation. Your anxiety will disappear next week but, in the meantime, keep reminding yourself that life is to be enjoyed and that it’s really all good.|01-04-2014|aquarius
35|You may be incredibly ambitious but don’t be too pushy this coming week or you could make enemies of people who should be friends. Remember, the best way to help yourself is to help others first. It’s good business and good politics.|01-05-2014|aquarius
36|You tend to fear the worst at this time of year, so don’t be surprised if you find yourself a bit hesitant as the new week begins. The good news is the tide is already beginning to turn and come the weekend you’ll be your old self again.|01-06-2014|aquarius
37|What you have to do today may seem boring, but if you do it well, you will come to the attention of powerful people and, in the long-term, the rewards will be worth the effort many times over. Invest some time in your future. |01-07-2014|aquarius
38|You may think that someone is keeping something from you, and maybe they are, but don’t let it worry you. It’s unlikely to be bad news and it’s even possible they are planning some kind of surprise. Don’t spoil it by peeking too soon.|01-08-2014|aquarius
39|You may think you can do as you please at the moment but you are kidding yourself and today’s events will bring that fact home to you sharply. There are forces operating behind the scenes that limit your options. Be aware of that fact.|01-09-2014|aquarius
40|Don’t reject an idea just because it seems impractical. It may look that way at the moment but a few days from now you will see it in a different light, one that makes you realize that if you want something enough you can find a way to get it.|01-10-2014|aquarius
41||01-11-2014|aquarius
42|Everyone seems to have an opinion about what is wrong with your life but they might as well save their breath. As far as you are concerned this is just a temporary storm and in a matter of days everything will be sunshine and light again.|01-12-2014|aquarius
43|You will get the chance to help someone in need and you won’t think twice about it. However, it might be wise to make clear that you expect them to look after themselves after that. You don’t want them getting at you every day!|01-13-2014|aquarius
44|Sometimes you can be too suspicious for your own good and as the Sun moves through the most secretive area of your chart you must not let the more distrustful side of your nature take control. In the long-term you’re the one who will suffer.|01-14-2014|aquarius
45|You seem to be in a fighting mood at the moment but don’t lose sight of the fact that while some things are worth fighting for, other things are not. Pick your battles carefully and, most importantly, make sure your enemy is worthy.|01-15-2014|aquarius
46|Today’s full moon urges you to get your head out of the clouds and focus on the facts of your current situation. You will have to tighten your belt financially over the next few weeks but it will only hurt if your attitude is wrong.|01-16-2014|aquarius
47|The best way to help yourself today is to help other people. With mind planet Mercury linked nicely to your ruler Uranus you have a knack for knowing what those around you need – and will go out of your way to get it for them.|01-17-2014|aquarius
48|A new phase is about to begin but before it does there is something you must get out of the way. No doubt you would prefer to ignore it, but if you do you will regret it later. Remember, it’s the little things that have the biggest impact.|01-18-2014|aquarius
49|No matter how daunting the challenges you have to face you will win through with ease. The Sun moves into your birth sign on Monday and your courage and confidence will go off the scale. Look out world, Aquarius is back!|01-19-2014|aquarius
50|The Sun moves into your birth sign today, heralding the start of an extremely busy and fun time in your life. The things you do over the next few weeks will determine the level of success you enjoy over the few years, so do them well.|01-20-2014|aquarius
51|This is one of the most important times of the year for you and the Sun in your sign will see to it that whatever you decide to do is endowed with extra power. Aim to do good things for others and good things will come your way too.|01-21-2014|aquarius
52|There may be a thousand things in this life that delight you but there is one thing only that demands your attention over the coming 12 months. You know what it is and you know why it is so important, so make a start on it today, and then just keep going.|01-22-2014|aquarius
53|It does not matter that others do not believe in what you are doing – the only thing that matters is that you believe in it. The whole world could be against you now but you will still come out on top. That’s a promise from the stars.|01-23-2014|aquarius
54|In the eyes of the world you can do no wrong, so be more adventurous and don’t worry if you tread on other people’s toes – most likely they will apologize to you! In every way you are moving faster than just about anyone and everyone.|01-24-2014|aquarius
55|You may at times wonder if you are on the right track and making the most of your talents but you will push ahead regardless. This time next year you will look back and marvel at how far you have come – and give yourself a pat on the back for staying the course.|01-25-2014|aquarius
56|A new moon in your sign in midweek indicates a new start in whatever area you think most needs to change. With Uranus, your ruler, on great form as well there will be events that both surprise and delight you. It’s all good.|01-26-2014|aquarius
57|The world is yours for the taking – all you have to do is identify what it is you most want to accomplish then just get on and make it happen. Can it really be that easy? Yes it can and by this time next year chances are you will be both famous and rich.|01-27-2014|aquarius
58|There is no point playing safe. On the contrary, you should seek out situations that test what you are capable of, because it is only by being tested that you will realize how much you can do – about ten times as much as you are doing right now!|01-28-2014|aquarius
59|Wherever you are and whatever you happen to be doing now, you will be somewhere else doing something completely different 12 months from now. You have always wanted to travel and be unusual. You’re about to get your chance.|01-29-2014|aquarius
60|Today’s new moon in your sign marks this out as the perfect time to start something new and exciting, something you always wanted to do but never before had the courage to begin. Well, now you do – so get on and make it a triumph.|01-30-2014|aquarius
61|Put your own needs first over the coming year and don’t worry too much about what others are up to. Something (or someone) that has annoyed you for ages will fade from your life over the next few months and you’ll feel so much better for it.|01-31-2014|aquarius
62|Something that has been an obstacle to your growth for months, maybe even years, will be removed over the next 48 hours, allowing you to move swiftly toward your goal again. If you can, help remove an obstacle for a friend as well.|02-01-2014|aquarius
63|You need to be challenged, you need to be pushed, you need to be made aware that you are capable of doing so much more. And you will be. Your birthday chart indicates that the coming 12 months will stretch you – and reward you – like never before.|02-03-2014|aquarius
64|If you put your mind to it today you can change something about yourself that you have disliked for a very long time. How will you do that? By replacing a bad habit with a good habit. There’s no reason a good habit can’t be fun.|02-04-2014|aquarius
65|Take a good look at what is annoying or upsetting you and ask yourself how important it really is. Most likely, you will come to the conclusion that it’s not worth another minute of your time or emotional energy. So forget it. |02-05-2014|aquarius
66|So many things will change in your life over the next 12 months that you may begin to feel that upheaval is quite normal. In a way that’s good because the world is moving faster by the day and not everyone has what it takes to keep up. But you do.|02-06-2014|aquarius
67|Fortune will smile on you over the coming year, but its smile will be broader and brighter if you meet it halfway and do the kind of things that will get you noticed. You possess that indefinable something which is called “star quality”. Don’t waste it.|02-07-2014|aquarius
68|Wherever you go and whatever you do over the coming 12 months, your guardian angel will be watching over you, so by all means push the boundaries a little. You should not be reckless, of course, but taking calculated risks will be fun — and profitable.|02-08-2014|aquarius
69|You may be sociable by nature but you must make sure you get plenty of private time, especially if you are the sort of Aquarius who is constantly trying to make sense of the world you inhabit. The deeper your thoughts the wider your understanding will be.|02-10-2014|aquarius
70|Your head and your heart are working well together at the moment, but unfortunately some of the people you have to deal with are so mixed up their presence in your life is becoming a liability. So get rid of them. Be ruthless. |02-11-2014|aquarius
71|You will find your voice this year – and once you’ve found it you won’t stop talking! Get involved in the big issues of the day and make sure your point of view is out there in the marketplace of ideas. You will win a lot of arguments, and a lot of new friends.|02-12-2014|aquarius
72|The bigger the challenge the more you like it. Your sense of adventure is such that you don’t mind what life throws at you – as far as you are concerned each and every problem is an opportunity for fun. Hold on to that feeling right though the year.|02-13-2014|aquarius
73|Today’s full moon can either be a positive or a negative influence, depending on how you choose to react to people who annoy you. No matter what they do or say just smile and refuse to get angry. They’re really not worth the bother.|02-14-2014|aquarius
74|The Sun and Mars combine on your birthday to give you all the energy and all the ambition you will ever need. However, as retrograde Mercury is also strong you must be rational in your thinking. Deal with the world as it is, not as you wish it to be.|02-15-2014|aquarius
75|Be ready to change direction at a moment’s notice over the coming 12 months. Even if you are the sort who stubbornly refuses to move with the times it is in your interests to be more flexible – and more adventurous. Make the effort – you’ll enjoy it.|02-17-2014|aquarius
76|For some time you have been torn between two possible futures for yourself and it’s got to the stage where being unable to decide is driving you mad. So why not embrace them both? You don’t have to commit yourself to just one way of living. Give it a go.|02-18-2014|aquarius
77|What you are currently worrying about is not worth the time or the effort. A few days from now, you will look back and wonder how you could have gotten so worked up about something so trivial. Why not get wise to it now? |02-19-2014|aquarius
78|Limit your spending to essentials today. You know how easy it is to reach into your pocket and find cash for this or that trinket but if you do that now you may have nothing left for the weekend – and that’s when the fun begins!|02-20-2014|aquarius
79|Just because you see things in a clear and logical way does not mean other people see with the same kind of eyes or understanding. You will encounter someone today who is rather dull-witted. You have to accept that some people will never “get it”.|02-21-2014|aquarius
80|You seem to believe that there is some sort of conspiracy against you. Yes, of course, you are overreacting but even so you would be wise not to give away too much about yourself this weekend. The less others know about your activities the better.|02-22-2014|aquarius
81|You like to splash out occasionally and the current cosmic set-up makes it difficult to keep your money in your pocket. Promise yourself now, before the new week begins, that you will limit yourself to a fixed amount of spending money every day.|02-23-2014|aquarius
82|You need to protect what you have gained, which is considerable. Common sense tells you that your winning streak can’t last forever and that if you carry on taking risks you could lose it all. Maybe it’s time to cash in some of those chips.|02-24-2014|aquarius
83|If you want something enough you will find a way to get it, no matter how many obstacles are placed in your path. Whatever challenges you face you are big enough and tough enough to deal with them – in fact they bring out the best in you.|02-25-2014|aquarius
84|You want to do something for people who are in some way less well off than you. That’s very noble of you but don’t just throw your money at the first good cause that comes along. Get involved in a project that will make a lasting difference.|02-26-2014|aquarius
85|You don’t take risks often but when you do you go all the way. With that thought in mind you are advised to wait until the weekend to follow up on what you are planning. If you start too early you could lose it all.|02-27-2014|aquarius
86|Any self-doubts you have will start to fade today and with luck will be swept away completely by tomorrow’s new moon. Other people expect you to be confident and positive in your views and the last thing you want is to disappoint them.|02-28-2014|aquarius
87|Look for new ways to improve your cash flow situation. Today’s new moon, backed up by the power of luck planet Jupiter, will inspire you to focus your money-making energies in one specific direction. The first million is always the best!|03-01-2014|aquarius
88|You may have higher standards than most but don’t try to be a perfectionist. Even an Aquarius is allowed to let things slip once in a while and what happens this week will remind you that you are human, despite what some people say!|03-02-2014|aquarius
89|You would do well to remember today that even an Aquarius has limits. It may feel as if you can take on the world and win, and maybe you can, but there is sure to be a downside, especially if you come on strong when you don’t have to.|03-03-2014|aquarius
90|You will be a hero to some and a villain to others today – there will be no in between. Whatever it is you say that causes a fuss don’t let anyone tell you that you should have kept quiet. You have every right to speak your mind.|03-04-2014|aquarius
91|There is nothing you cannot do. There is no one you cannot impress. With Venus, planet of harmony, joining Mercury in your sign today doors will open as if by magic and heads will turn as you walk down the street. You’re worth watching!|03-05-2014|aquarius
92|Jupiter moves in your favor today, making it easy to break free of habits and routines that are holding you back. Remember: the best way to get rid of a habit you’ve become used to is to replace it with a better one that challenges you.|03-06-2014|aquarius
93|You seem to be in two minds whether to push ahead quickly with a new plan or to hold back and see how things develop. Hopefully it will be the former as the longer you wait the more likely it is others will get ahead of you.|03-07-2014|aquarius
94|Do you proceed with caution or do you act on the spur of the moment? If an opportunity arises this weekend that demands a response you must act quickly and decisively. You will surely regret it later if you hesitate now.|03-08-2014|aquarius
95|No matter how complicated things seem to get over the next few days the planets indicate it is all quite simple. There is an explanation for everything that happens, so stay calm and make the best of events, be they “good” or be they “bad”.s|03-09-2014|aquarius
96|You may have to force yourself to be enthusiastic about what has to be done today but it will be worth the effort. By midweek at the latest everyone will be patting you on the back and saying what a great job you’ve done.|03-10-2014|aquarius
97|Changes on the work front may not be what you were hoping for but later in the year you will realize they were exactly what you needed, so don’t be too negative about them. You will be moving up in the world again before too long.|03-11-2014|aquarius
98|Make a conscious effort to stand above petty battles and see the bigger picture. It may look as if the world is going to hell in a handcart but that’s only because you are taking too narrow a view of events. Look for deeper and wider meanings.|03-12-2014|aquarius
99|There is always an answer, even to the most difficult of questions, so don’t lose heart if your existence isn’t easy. Despite what some people choose to believe life is, was and always will be a garden of delights. If you can’t see that – you need glasses!|03-13-2014|aquarius
100|With Mercury in your sign linked to Mars your mind will move fast, so fast in fact that it may take a while for the rest of you to catch up! Be careful you don’t exhaust yourself – something that can happen to your mind as well as your body.|03-14-2014|aquarius
101|Sacrifices of one sort or another will have to be made over the next few days. You will also have to accept that you are going to have less cash in your pocket for a while. But money doesn’t make you happy – right?|03-15-2014|aquarius
102|If someone you live, work or do business with makes life difficult for no good reason this week don’t get uptight about it. Most likely it’s the influence of the full moon coming into play. You won’t get anywhere by being too tense or aggressive.|03-16-2014|aquarius
103|Don’t let anyone pressure you into doing something you don’t feel 100 per cent happy about. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to money matters. What you own and what you earn are under serious stars, so don’t take chances.|03-17-2014|aquarius
104|Today’s link between values planet Venus, currently in your sign, and your ruling planet Uranus will encourage you to believe that life is good and getting better by the minute. Your thoughts, and your feelings, create the world you experience.|03-18-2014|aquarius
105|The more you are on the move over the next few days the more likely it is you will find answers to the questions you have been asking. You may not be thrilled by some of the things you learn but the truth is about facts, not feelings.|03-19-2014|aquarius
106|The Sun moves in your favour today, making it easy to get your own way. Does that fill your head with ideas? It should, and each and every one of those ideas is entirely legitimate. Use your powers of persuasion to make a profit.|03-20-2014|aquarius
107|You want to get on in the world, you want to make a difference in a good way, but how do you actually do that? What happens over the next 24 hours will point you in the right direction. After that, all you have to do is march!|03-21-2014|aquarius
108|A social event will have to be put on the back burner while you take care of family and financial issues. The good news is that today’s Mercury-Neptune link will inspire you to spot new money-making opportunities. Keep them to yourself.|03-22-2014|aquarius
109|You will feel on top of the world over the next few days, which is great, but there is a danger that because you feel so good you will do something silly, something you regret big|03-23-2014|aquarius
110|Let a friend who is feeling a bit down at the moment know you are there for them. Your warm words could be all it takes to get them smiling again and one small act of kindness could have a knock-on effect that transforms their life.|03-24-2014|aquarius
111|With both the Sun and Uranus moving through one of the better areas of your chart you no doubt feel ready for a new adventure. That’s great, but if you are on the move you should plan your route carefully and allow for delays and diversions.|03-25-2014|aquarius
112|Mercury in the money area of your chart suggests that Lady Luck will be smiling on you over the next few days. If you do find you have extra cash in your pocket why not treat someone you love to an afternoon or evening out?|03-26-2014|aquarius
113|A remark you toss out into the conversation may not be meant in a negative way but that’s how one person may take it. If they do seem offended let them know straight away that you meant no harm by it. Don’t lose a friend over something trivial.|03-27-2014|aquarius
114|An investment you made a while back will pay off today and looking back you will be glad you had the sense to act on what your inner voice told you. What it’s telling you now is to keep your feet on the ground and not get carried away.|03-28-2014|aquarius
115||03-29-2014|aquarius
116|You need to get your thoughts in order before the Sun links with Uranus, your ruler, on Thursday. To do so you may have to shut yourself away for a while so you are not distracted by noisy and annoying people – that’s just about everyone!|03-30-2014|aquarius
117|If you want to convince authority figures that you know what you are talking about then you must back up your opinions with facts. If you can’t do that convincingly then maybe it would be best if you just stayed quiet today.|03-31-2014|aquarius
118|There is no point getting annoyed about things that are beyond your control – you know that already. So why are you allowing what everyone agrees is a quite minor event to cause major shockwaves in your life? Get over it – now.|04-01-2014|aquarius
119|Consider all the options and all the possibilities before deciding what you are going to do next. Better still, do nothing at all. Loved ones and work colleagues may be annoyed that you are dragging your feet but what can they do about it?|04-02-2014|aquarius
120|The Sun at odds with power planet Pluto today warns you must resist the temptation to go to extremes. If you overstep the mark either at home or at work you could end up paying a very high price. Know your limits and stay within them.|04-03-2014|aquarius
121|A light-hearted attitude will take you a long way today. The planets suggest if you take nothing too seriously then nothing too serious will go wrong. In the greater scheme of things, no matter what happens, it all comes right in the end.|04-04-2014|aquarius
122|For some reason you are reluctant to take the kind of risk that at most others times you would not even think about. Maybe your subconscious is trying to protect you. Maybe it is aware of something your everyday mind is not.|04-05-2014|aquarius
123|Are your instincts reliable? On most occasions they can be trusted to point you in the right direction but over the next few days they may not be quite so dependable, so think twice before taking action – then think again, just to be sure.|04-06-2014|aquarius
124|You will find it much easier to get your message across today and that’s good because you have plenty to say. Your way with words will help you to persuade others that you know what you are talking about – though it doesn’t mean you do!|04-07-2014|aquarius
125|The efforts you have put in over the past few months will pay off in a big way eventually, so don’t get disheartened if it seems you are not making much progress. Beneath the surface of your life a great transformation is taking shape.|04-08-2014|aquarius
126|If you want a creative endeavor to be a success you are going to need help and with so much positive cosmic activity this is a good time to ask. Others want to be on your team, not least because they know it’s the one most likely to win.|04-09-2014|aquarius
127|You may not get much in the way of thanks for a good deed today but that’s okay. The world would be a sad place indeed if we only ever did favors for others because we expected to get something back in return.|04-10-2014|aquarius
128|The more open and outgoing you have been in recent weeks the more you need to spend some time by yourself now. This is a time both for thinking and for coming to terms with your feelings. You can’t do that at yet another party.|04-11-2014|aquarius
129|Be careful what you say this weekend because your rivals will be watching and listening more carefully than usual and won’t hesitate to make you look bad if they get the chance. Above all, don’t exaggerate in any way, shape or form.|04-12-2014|aquarius
130|The contacts you make over the next few days will come in useful later in the year when you need to build support for what you are planning to do. No matter how busy you are at the moment make time to be sociable.|04-13-2014|aquarius
131|Be careful what you decide today because once you have made up your mind about something the planets won’t let you change back again. Remember too that while you may not be in control of events your emotions are always yours to command.|04-14-2014|aquarius
132|This is still a pretty good time for you but today’s eclipse warns you need to take care, especially when socializing and traveling. If you do too much there is a danger you could exhaust yourself – and you’ll still have all those chores to finish.|04-15-2014|aquarius
133|If you feel the need to go out and have a good time then do so and don’t feel in the least bit guilty about it. Put your troubles behind you and do whatever makes you feel glad to be alive. Life is supposed to be fun.|04-16-2014|aquarius
134|For some unexplained reason you seem reluctant to take chances at the moment and according to the planets you are right to hold back. A lot will change over the next four or five days, so wait a bit before making your next big move.|04-17-2014|aquarius
135|Although money matters and other material issues may be important that does not mean you have to focus on them to the exclusion of everything else. Man does not live by bread alone – the heart and the spirit matter too.|04-18-2014|aquarius
136|You cannot possibly carry on at your current frenzied pace, so take a breather and see more of the people you love. The Sun’s move into the domestic area of your chart this weekend means family time is more important than work time.|04-19-2014|aquarius
137|Your feelings will be rather intense over the next few days and anyone who expects you to be your usual sunny self may be in for a shock. That’s okay. Even an Aquarius is allowed an off day, or three, once in a while.|04-20-2014|aquarius
138|You may not be in the mood to make allowances for those who think and act more slowly than you but the planets warn you don’t have much choice in the matter. Under no circumstances clash with people in positions of power. You’ll lose.|04-21-2014|aquarius
139|The planets indicate that your best course of action today is to take no action at all. That might sound rather negative but with Mars and Jupiter battling it out the sensible thing to do is to keep your head down and let others take the risks.|04-22-2014|aquarius
140|You will learn something to your advantage over the next 24 hours but if you are smart you will keep it to yourself for now. Knowledge is power and what you find out about a situation could be beneficial both personally and financially.|04-23-2014|aquarius
141|You get on well with most people but you also need to be aware that there are individuals out there who are so different to you in temperament that it’s unlikely you will ever be friends. That’s okay – it’s what makes for such an interesting world.|04-24-2014|aquarius
142|You are on a winning streak at the moment and the planets indicate it will continue into the weekend. It doesn’t have to be just about money – you will be lucky in love as well. Someone you work with thinks you’re extra special.|04-25-2014|aquarius
143|There is no point getting upset about events over which you have no control. No matter what happens over the next 48 hours you must stay calm. Think of life as a contest – a contest you are more likely to win if you don’t take it too seriously.|04-26-2014|aquarius
144|Issues you have been avoiding will be brought to a head this week and that’s good because it means you will finally have to deal with them. There is a real possibility of making a new start, but first you must face up to emotional issues.|04-27-2014|aquarius
145|The task you are faced with today may seem daunting but if you attack it in the right way – that is, with a song in your heart and a smile on your face – there is no doubt at all you will make a success of it. You really can’t lose.|04-28-2014|aquarius
146|Make sure you get the up front support of loved ones before embarking on a new course of action. Try to persuade them that what you desire for yourself will also be good for them. It would help, of course, if it was true.|04-29-2014|aquarius
147|Focus on helping other people today. Everyone knows you are talented and destined to move up in the world but what they may not know is that you get a huge kick from doing good for others. For Aquarius “us” is more important than “me”.|04-30-2014|aquarius
148|You appear to believe that your feelings for a certain person are a one-way street but that is far from the truth. They care as much for you as you do for them but, for the moment at least, they’ve got other things to worry about. Be patient.|05-01-2014|aquarius
149|The good news is you seem to be handling challenges well and the even better news is that it won’t be long before you are rewarded in some way. Everything evens out in the end, so keep believing that the good times will return.|05-02-2014|aquarius
150|Family and friends will happily help you in whatever it is you are trying to do but only if they know what you are trying to do – and that means you must tell them. You’re not a mind reader so what makes you think they are?|05-03-2014|aquarius
151|It does not matter that everyone else seems to be running around at top speed you should be taking life at a much slower pace. The right opportunities will come to you at just the right time, so why exhaust yourself when you don’t have to?|05-04-2014|aquarius
152|What happens over the next 24 hours will remind you that it is not where you look but how you look that determines the way the world seems to be. Be positive and purposeful in everything you say and do – and the world will reflect your attitude.|05-05-2014|aquarius
153|Something is holding you back, something is stopping you from reaching your true potential. According to the planets it could be your own self-doubt that is preventing you from pushing ahead. Don’t be so negative: you’ve got what it takes.|05-06-2014|aquarius
154|Now that Mercury, planet of the mind, is moving into your fellow Air sign of Gemini the mental turmoil of the past few weeks will just fade away. Well, hopefully. You can certainly make things easier for yourself by not worrying so much.|05-07-2014|aquarius
155|Don’t worry if you lose out in some way over the next 24 hours because you will more than make up for it later in the month. If something seems to be slipping from your grasp just let it go. Change is always good in the long-term.|05-08-2014|aquarius
156|Make sure you have all the facts at your fingertips because it is the only way you can be certain you are not being deceived. The planets warn that unscrupulous people won’t hesitate to cheat you if they think they can get away with it.|05-09-2014|aquarius
157|The planets warn there will be arguments and bad feelings to deal with over the next 48 hours. Some people may be unwilling or incapable of seeing sense but you must not allow yourself to stoop to their level. You’re better than that.|05-10-2014|aquarius
158|You will get the chance to cheer up a friend or love done who has been feeling a bit down of late. A dose of your optimistic take on life is just what they need to get their act together and start looking on the bright side again.|05-11-2014|aquarius
159|If you are looking for ways to make money you will come up with plenty of ideas over the next 24 hours. The only danger is you may do nothing with them. One good idea acted on is better than a dozen that just sit there.|05-12-2014|aquarius
160|A difference of opinion with a friend or family member could easily get out of hand over the next 48 hours, so promise yourself now that no matter what is said you won’t overreact. Come the end of the week it will all be forgotten.|05-13-2014|aquarius
161|It will be easy to get annoyed with certain people today but if you are wise you will call upon your reserves of self-control and make a virtue of being both patient and forgiving. If you do fall out with someone, forgive and forget quickly.|05-14-2014|aquarius
162|Someone new will come into your life today. Is it a true love match or is it just a passing fancy? You may not know for sure until later in the year but if it’s making you smile now it can’t be all bad – so enjoy!|05-15-2014|aquarius
163|You may be a bit confused about your goals at the moment but don’t worry about it — in a matter of days your mind will be clear and the way ahead will be nicely mapped out for you. Listen to, and follow, your heart.|05-16-2014|aquarius
164|There are so many things you want to do but if you try to get them all done at once chances are you’ll get nowhere. The only pressure you are under is the pressure you put on yourself, so slow down and tackle one task at a time.|05-17-2014|aquarius
165|Put all thoughts of fear and failure behind you and strike out in a new direction. The Sun’s entry into the most dynamic area of your chart on the 21st will give you the boost you need to get working on what you were born to do.|05-18-2014|aquarius
166|Some people think you are spending too much time enjoying yourself and not enough on your chores and responsibilities. Maybe they’re right but you’re not going to change your ways. Tell them to mind their own business. Better still, ignore them.|05-19-2014|aquarius
167|It may seem as if your rivals are being favored while you are being ignored but even if that is true why should it worry you? Since when have you been the sort who needs other people to help you? Carve your own path through life.|05-20-2014|aquarius
168|All the worries of recent weeks will be swept away over the next 24 hours. No matter how difficult things have been for you up until now you will find new sources of energy and new ways to make your dreams come true. Enjoy life!|05-21-2014|aquarius
169|You will be on inspired form over the next two or three days. The Sun in Gemini will encourage you to believe that all things are possible and that taking risks is not an option but a necessity. Life is about to get interesting!|05-22-2014|aquarius
170|The dark days are behind you and everything is happiness and light. Well, okay, maybe it’s not that good – yet – but it’s now within your power to change your life in major ways. Forget about yesterday, today is the only day that matters.|05-23-2014|aquarius
171|It may seem as if you don’t have a care in the world but underneath that calm exterior you are struggling with some serious questions about where your life is heading. Lighten up. It’s the journey that matters, not the destination.|05-24-2014|aquarius
172|Life is full of possibilities and several of those possibilities will make an appearance in your life over the next few days. The approaching new moon will give you the confidence you need to follow your dream and make it a reality.|05-25-2014|aquarius
173|You will take great strides over the next few days but where to? You have so many options open to you now but you need to choose one and stick with it. Focus your energy on a single goal and don’t stop until you reach it.|05-26-2014|aquarius
174|The approaching new moon encourages you to believe that you can get away with anything. It may not be entirely true but you will act as if it is and for that reason alone you will no doubt do something amazing. You ARE amazing.|05-27-2014|aquarius
175|Today’s new moon in your fellow Air sign of Gemini will inspire you to be creative and put your talents to good use. Relationships will go well too, so be assertive and dynamic and make sure others know what it is you desire.|05-28-2014|aquarius
176|Sometimes you get so caught up in making a living and making your way in the world that you forget there are people who love you so much they really don’t care what you achieve. One such person will delight you today.|05-29-2014|aquarius
177|With both the Sun and Mars well placed in your chart you can easily find ways to get past other people’s defenses. You can, if you choose, be subtle about it but more likely you prefer to blast your way through. It’s certainly more fun!|05-30-2014|aquarius
178|You will go over the top in some way this weekend but that’s okay. The planets will protect you no matter how far you go beyond accepted norms. It’s not often you get the chance to be this adventurous, so make the most of it.|05-31-2014|aquarius
179|If someone betrays your trust don’t let it make you too cynical. There are still plenty of people out there who are honest and trustworthy, so don’t think everyone is on the make and don’t shut yourself away. The world needs you.|06-01-2014|aquarius
180|If you kid yourself into believing that certain things are true when they clearly are not it could lead to a costly mistake. If you must take a risk make sure you know all the facts. Don’t ignore something just because you don’t like it.|06-02-2014|aquarius
181|Life seems more vibrant and exciting now and in a way that’s strange as nothing much has actually changed. What is different is your attitude: where before you were too negative now you are determined to find silver linings everywhere.|06-03-2014|aquarius
182|Stand back from your petty, everyday worries and see life from a wider perspective. It may seem that the odds are stacked against you but that is an illusion brought about by too narrow a focus. Expand your horizons and embrace the world.|06-04-2014|aquarius
183|The planets warn that a clash of egos could get rather heated over the next 24 hours, but the results should be positive. Hopefully it will get you thinking in new and more profitable directions. Never be too fixed in your opinions.|06-05-2014|aquarius
184|Seek out people who are different in some way and don’t be afraid to show them that you are different too. With Uranus, your ruler, on excellent terms with the Sun today anything that is out of the ordinary will work in your favor.|06-06-2014|aquarius
185|If you go out of your way to help people today they will go out of their way to help you later on. The universe never forgets a good deed – nor a bad one for that matter – so make the effort and make someone’s life a bit easier.|06-07-2014|aquarius
186|The quicker you want to move the slower everyone around you seems to go, which is so frustrating. Sadly, there is not much you can do to change things right now, so be patient and wait for the cosmic picture to move in your favor again. |06-08-2014|aquarius
187|Someone in a position of authority is watching you closely and if they like what they see you will gain in many ways over the coming week. The one thing that may put them off is if you are too rigid in your thinking. As if!|06-09-2014|aquarius
188|You may be tempted to get involved in an issue that is not your concern but if you are smart you will see it for what it is – a bundle of trouble – and give it a miss. It will work itself out in the end, with or without your input.|06-10-2014|aquarius
189|Push yourself forward today and let people in positions of power know who you are and what you can do. Most likely they know already but it won’t hurt to remind them – they like people who are keen to get ahead in the world.|06-11-2014|aquarius
190|Don’t let anyone tell you that you have been lucky or that you do not deserve your good fortune, because luck has nothing to do with it. The fact is you deserve every good thing now coming your way. You make your own destiny.|06-12-2014|aquarius
191|The more you get out and about and socialize now the more likely it is you will learn something to your advantage. Before the day is over you will be good friends with someone who shares your beliefs, ideals and taste for adventure.|06-13-2014|aquarius
192|You don’t need anyone’s permission to get on and do what motivates you the most. With both the Sun and Mars moving through dynamic areas of your chart you should act first and explain yourself, if you really have to, later on.|06-14-2014|aquarius
193|For some reason you are reluctant to take chances at the moment and the planets indicate you are right to hold back. A lot of unexpected things are going to happen over the next few days, so try not to commit yourself.|06-15-2014|aquarius
194|When the Sun changes signs next weekend your workload is likely to increase substantially, so the fewer things you have on the go now the better. Cut back on your commitments and take a break – no one deserves it more than you.|06-16-2014|aquarius
195|It’s not like you to be negative but you seem to believe that a creative activity of some kind is no longer worth the effort. You’re wrong. Put it out of your mind for a while but don’t give up on it altogether. It will come good eventually.|06-17-2014|aquarius
196|If you feel you are not being appreciated or rewarded enough in your current job or occupation then start making plans. Could you be making more of your talents elsewhere? Most likely you could, so be open to new possibilities.|06-18-2014|aquarius
197|What are you waiting for? Why do you hesitate? Something is holding you back from taking risks, even small ones, and that’s a shame because the planets suggest that if you take a chance today it could pay off in a big way. Do you dare?|06-19-2014|aquarius
198|Can you trust what other people tell you? No you cannot. They may not be trying to trick you as such but there is reason to believe they themselves have been deceived, so err on the side of caution and trust your own instincts first and last.|06-20-2014|aquarius
199|Wave goodbye to wishful thinking and focus only on the realities of your present situation. That does not mean your dreams must be abandoned but it does mean you need to get serious about which of them stand a chance of success.|06-21-2014|aquarius
200|A little caution would be no bad thing over the next two or three days, especially where relationships are concerned. You have a tendency to rush into new situations with no thought for the consequences, so keep the first aid kit handy!|06-22-2014|aquarius
201|Venus, planet of harmony, moves into the most creative area of your chart today, so it’s unlikely you will want to be too serious about, well, just about anything. This is not the time to be solemn. Life is supposed to be fun.|06-23-2014|aquarius
202|You may be in the mood to settle an old score but is that really sensible? Focus only on positive objectives and pretend that negative and annoying people do not exist. Then get busy on what really matters: making your first million.|06-24-2014|aquarius
203|Someone you meet on your travels will become very important to you in the weeks and months to come. You will be on exactly the same wavelength mentally and emotionally – and there is even the chance that romance could blossom.|06-25-2014|aquarius
204|If you make a mistake today just admit it and move on. Life is a succession of tests and the powers that guide your life do not expect you to pass every one of them, at least not first time. You’ll do much better tomorrow.|06-26-2014|aquarius
205|Others may crack the whip and insist that you work harder but don’t do it. You may have plenty of time and energy at your disposal but you should be using it to further your own aims, not the aims of other people.|06-27-2014|aquarius
206|This should be a productive weekend for you but there is a danger you could waste time and energy on tasks that bring no benefit to you personally. The more people ask of you the more important the word “no” becomes.|06-28-2014|aquarius
207|Most things seem to be going well but there is a possibility you have drifted a bit off course. Now that mind planet Mercury is moving in your favor again it will be easy to identify where that has happened and where to make changes.|06-29-2014|aquarius
208|Be forceful and dynamic and make the most of whatever new opportunities come your way. Everything will work out for the best if you believe in yourself and if you believe that the Universe is on your side. It is and always will be.|06-30-2014|aquarius
209|Others will come to you for advice today – just when you wanted to be on your own with your thoughts. You are too nice a person to turn them away, so help solve their problems – and, just maybe, it may help solve a few of your own.|07-01-2014|aquarius
210|Your ability to tune in to how others think and feel will bring benefits today, especially on the work front where sudden changes won’t take you as much by surprise as they do some people. Somehow, you sensed they were coming.|07-02-2014|aquarius
211|Your passion for a creative project of some kind knows no bounds. There is, however, a danger that you could lose touch with reality and allow it to become all-consuming. Don’t forget to come up for air, and kisses and chocolate, occasionally.|07-03-2014|aquarius
212|The quality you most need today is patience – and lots of it. Come the weekend you will be able to start doing things again but over the next 24 hours control your urge to push ahead. Starting too soon may be worse than not starting at all.|07-04-2014|aquarius
213|What happens over the next 48 hours will be good for you but maybe not so good for other people. Don’t let that worry you though because the more you achieve now the more you will be able to help others later on when it matters.|07-05-2014|aquarius
214|Any bad feelings you may have must be brought into the open this week. Only then will you be able to deal with them. It does not matter how bad a rift may be, your way with words will help find a solution everyone is happy with.|07-06-2014|aquarius
215|Don’t give up on a relationship just because it is going through a bad patch. It is times like these that test your commitment and the planets suggest that if you hang in there the tide will turn in your favor soon enough.|07-07-2014|aquarius
216|Today’s link between the Sun and your ruling planet Uranus will give you the impetus you need, if not to transform your life, at least to change those areas where you are still not happy with your performance. Don’t leave it any longer.|07-08-2014|aquarius
217|The tighter you hold on to something over the next few days the more painful it will be when the full moon takes it from you at the weekend. That is the lesson you now need to learn and it applies to people as well as possessions.|07-09-2014|aquarius
218|Don’t argue with people who clearly do not know what they are talking about – it’s a waste of your precious time and energy. Focus on what really matters over the next 24 hours: your work, your family and your long-term ambitions.|07-10-2014|aquarius
219|The more someone criticizes you the more determined you will be to carry on with what you are doing. They should know by now that telling you not to do something will most likely result in you doing precisely that.|07-11-2014|aquarius
220|If someone lets you down this weekend you must resist the urge to say something hurtful. It may seem like a big deal now but later you will look back and wonder why you allowed yourself to get so worked up about it.|07-12-2014|aquarius
221|Don’t worry if a relationship has been a bit strained of late because now that Jupiter is moving into your opposite sign of Leo you can easily be friends again. Whatever differences you may have they are petty in the extreme, so ignore them.|07-13-2014|aquarius
222|You don’t usually let your passions get the better of you but they will do so today. You won’t care in the slightest what other people think about what you do or say. That is, you won’t care today – tomorrow, however, you may be embarrassed!|07-14-2014|aquarius
223|The world is full of people who are eager to conform but you’re not one of them and what you say and do over the next 24 hours will remind certain individuals of that fact. They won’t take you for granted again!|07-15-2014|aquarius
224|If there is something you need to own up to do then do so now as Jupiter, planet of good fortune, moves into your opposite sign. Most likely you have been worrying about it for no good reason. Loved ones don’t really care.|07-16-2014|aquarius
225|If you are motivated purely by greed you are unlikely to get what you desire. If, however, you are driven by a genuine desire to help other people you will succeed beyond your wildest dreams. Remember: you get out what you put in.|07-17-2014|aquarius
226|A friend or family member will ask you to cover up for them in some way today and you’ll be happy to do so. But hold on. You don’t want to see them get hurt, of course, but shouldn’t they be learning from their own mistakes?|07-18-2014|aquarius
227|An authority figure will ask you to work with someone you don’t get on with today and you really don’t have much choice in the matter. Make a point of being fair with them – they may not be as incompetent as you believe.|07-19-2014|aquarius
228|Are you being too optimistic? Are you allowing your imagination to carry you away? Maybe you are but so what! A positive attitude is essential over the next few days, especially if you are the kind of Aquarius who tends to take life too seriously.|07-20-2014|aquarius
229|Even the best of friends fall out occasionally – it’s no big deal. You will get the chance to kiss and make up later in the week and if you take it there will be no lasting harm done. Next time, try not to get so emotional.|07-21-2014|aquarius
230||07-22-2014|aquarius
231|Be nice to those you meet and do business with today, because you are going to need their help over the next few weeks. A smile and a few kind words will go a long way towards winning important people over to your side.|07-23-2014|aquarius
232|If you want to get things done over the next few days you must bring other people into your plans. If you think you can do it all on your own you are mistaken, but like-minded people will make even the hardest tasks easy for you.|07-24-2014|aquarius
233|Mercury, planet of trickery, could mislead you into thinking that you have got the best of a deal when, in fact, others will profit a lot more than you. Check the small print carefully before putting pen to paper over the next 24 hours.|07-25-2014|aquarius
234|Why do you put up with a certain individual’s behavior? Is it because you are too nice? Or is it because you fear a backlash if you try to get tough? Either way, the situation cannot be allowed to continue, so get on top of it.|07-26-2014|aquarius
235|Don’t waste your time trying to give someone advice this week because they won’t listen. Don’t take it personally either. Some people need to make their own mistakes before they learn and perhaps that is the way it has to be.|07-27-2014|aquarius
236|Yes, you are still heading in the right direction. No, your life does not need a major rethink. Focus on putting one foot in front of the other this week and, in quite a short time, you will find yourself moving closer to your goal.|07-28-2014|aquarius
237|Sometimes it’s okay to put your own interests first. It’s good of you to want to help those in need but you have only so much time and energy at your disposal and you have legitimate desires too. Don’t deny yourself what you crave.|07-29-2014|aquarius
238|Because the Sun makes a difficult aspect to Neptune, planet of illusion, today you must make sure that your dreams have a solid basis in reality. Flights of fancy can be fun but if your head is in the clouds you must keep your feet on the ground.|07-30-2014|aquarius
239|Each time you think you are making progress someone changes the rules and it’s so frustrating! What the universe is trying to show you is that there are, in fact, no hard and fast rules at all. Make them up as you go along.|07-31-2014|aquarius
240|This is an excellent time for travel and social activities, and maybe affairs of the heart as well. You will be both chatty and charming today and will make a good impression on someone you have until now worshipped from afar.|08-01-2014|aquarius
241|You will be flavor of the month with just about everyone over the next 48 hours. By all means enjoy yourself but don’t get carried away and give someone the idea that they mean more to you romantically than is actually the case.|08-02-2014|aquarius
242|Something important will most likely go out of your life this week but don’t worry because something even better will come in to replace it. Just how good will depend to a large extent on the attitude you choose to adopt. Be positive.|08-03-2014|aquarius
243|Don’t be too hard on people whose beliefs are the opposite of your own. They are as entitled to their way of thinking and their way of doing things as you are to yours, so be tolerant and talk only about issues you can agree on.|08-04-2014|aquarius
244|Fate will point you in a new direction over the next few days and if you are wise you will go with the flow. There is no need to worry because the powers that be are looking over you and will always protect you.|08-05-2014|aquarius
245|The approaching full moon, which takes place in your birth sign at the weekend, is sure to upset your emotional equilibrium in some way. But it will also make you more sensitive to the needs of partners and colleagues, and that’s no bad thing.|08-06-2014|aquarius
246|Be precise in what you say. If you leave your words vague no one will know what it is you are trying to communicate and, as a consequence, nothing much will get done. Don’t worry about hurting other people’s feelings – only the truth matters.|08-07-2014|aquarius
247|If there is someone you want to get closer to emotionally you must not hesitate for even a moment: let them know how you feel. On the work front, too, the more you open up to other people the more they will want to do for you.|08-08-2014|aquarius
248|Upheavals of one kind or another are to be expected this weekend but they won’t be too bad. They may even turn out to be good if you stay sharp and look for ways to take advantage of them. With change comes opportunity.|08-09-2014|aquarius
249|You may fear the worst over a partnership issue, but do you really need to be so pessimistic about it? According to the planets this is just a passing phase and by the middle of the week you will be the best of friends again.|08-10-2014|aquarius
250|Don’t waste your time doing things you do not enjoy. Even if there is a task that needs to be completed there is no point forcing yourself if your heart is not in it. What will be will be, so let fate take its course.|08-11-2014|aquarius
251|Resist the urge to go to extremes when dealing with people you don’t much like or the bad feelings you create may come back at you towards the end of the week. If you really can’t stand them just stay out of their way.|08-12-2014|aquarius
252|Others may be rushing here, there and everywhere but you don’t have to follow their lead. According to the planets it’s largely meaningless activity, designed to make lazy people look busy. Focus on the one thing that really matters to you.|08-13-2014|aquarius
253|Anyone who thinks they can threaten you will discover just how tough a cookie you can be over the next 24 hours. Don’t worry that you might make a few enemies – that just means you are being taken seriously at last.|08-14-2014|aquarius
254|You need to be assertive now. You need to let everyone know that you are not in the mood to be taken for granted. There is, of course, a danger you will go too far and upset one or two people but they’ll get over it.|08-15-2014|aquarius
255|Take a break from all those restrictions you have imposed on yourself. It does not matter what obligations you think you have to take care of, you must also make time for the things you enjoy. If you’re not smiling, you’re not doing it right.|08-16-2014|aquarius
256|A free spirit like you should always have a way out ready and as the people you are currently involved with look a bit dodgy you are advised not to close off your escape routes. You may have to do some backtracking this week!|08-17-2014|aquarius
257|Don’t worry if a relationship seems to be on the slide because you will get the opportunity to bring it up to scratch again. Today’s Venus-Jupiter link in your opposite sign will bring out the best in you – and in other people too.|08-18-2014|aquarius
258|No matter what mistakes you have made you must forgive yourself and move on. It would also be a good idea to forgive others for the mistakes they made that affected you. Grudges don’t just hold others back, they hold you back too.|08-20-2014|aquarius
259|If you have to sign something today make sure you check the small print, because there could be some nasty surprises if you don’t take care. If you make a mistake now it could prove costly not only for you but for others as well.|08-21-2014|aquarius
260|Whatever you think is wrong with your life it is not nearly as bad as you fear, so stop worrying and start looking for ways you can bring the smile back to your face. Try helping others – you’re especially good at that.|08-22-2014|aquarius
261|Persuasion always works better than force and if you are smart this weekend you will find it quite easy to convince friends and colleagues to believe in you and – the really important bit – back their belief with some serious cash.|08-23-2014|aquarius
262|Money may not be that important to you but it is always nice to have enough of the stuff to do good works and what happens over the next few days will boost your income considerably. You might even be tempted to treat yourself.|08-24-2014|aquarius
263|Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs joint financial matters indicates that you could be on the receiving end of a windfall over the next few days. There are no certainties, of course, but if you do win you’ll no doubt win big.|08-26-2014|aquarius
264|You need to make a decision and you need to make it quickly. Actually, you know what needs to be done, what you have lacked up until now is the motivation to do it. What happens over the next 24 hours will finally inspire you.|08-27-2014|aquarius
265|Be careful what you say over the next 24 hours, especially when dealing with people in positions of power. You may have strong feelings about certain issues but you would be wise to keep them to yourself for the time being.|08-28-2014|aquarius
266|If you try to shift the blame for something you did wrong the results could be embarrassing. Everyone makes mistakes – yes, even an Aquarius – so hold up your hand and accept that you are at fault. Come tomorrow all will be forgotten.|08-29-2014|aquarius
267|You may be tempted to tear everything down and start again from scratch this weekend but is that such a good idea? It may seem to be the right thing to do now but if you are acting on impulse you will regret it next week.|08-30-2014|aquarius
268|On too many occasions in recent weeks you have looked at the world through eyes that see only the bad stuff. The good news is that as from midweek, when Mercury moves in your favor, the world will be a sunnier, happier place again.|08-31-2014|aquarius
269|What awaits you in the future is many times better than what you are leaving behind in the past, so be positive and, if you feel that your talents are being limited in your present environment, just move on to pastures new.|09-01-2014|aquarius
270|Get out and about and extend your range of contacts. You may be an individualist by nature but there is only so much progress you can make on your own. If you want to make a serious impact, reach out to people who share your ideals.|09-02-2014|aquarius
271|You may be tempted to forget about your principles and do something a bit underhand today but you are advised against it. You have a reputation for honesty and if something should go wrong you could lose it – and that’s a loss you can’t afford.|09-03-2014|aquarius
272|It would appear that you have overlooked something of importance, something that could make a big difference to your future. Give it some thought and when you have found what it is make sure you make it central to your plans.|09-04-2014|aquarius
273|You should be feeling a lot better about your financial prospects now that values planet Venus is moving into the wealth area of your chart. But don’t take too much for granted or you may end up spending too much – again!|09-05-2014|aquarius
274|Something you see or hear over the next 48 hours will provide you with a great deal of inspiration. You have been looking for something new to do and now it seems you have found it. Your creative juices are bubbling nicely.|09-06-2014|aquarius
275|You must be honest in all your dealings this week, at work, in business and especially in your private affairs. If others feel they can trust you they will open up in ways that bring only good things your way. You can’t lose.|09-07-2014|aquarius
276|It seems you have overestimated the return you will get from some sort of investment and, of course, you are disappointed. But it’s not the end of the world and maybe, in the long-term, it will work in your favor.|09-08-2014|aquarius
277|If you feel that you are being treated unfairly you must speak up about it – loudly. It’s a sad fact of life that those who make the biggest noise often get the biggest slice of the pie as well. Shout if you have to.|09-09-2014|aquarius
278|You may not want to admit it but deep down you know that a relationship is not working out the way you had hoped. Do you try again? Or do you admit defeat and go your separate ways? Only you can decide, so give it some thought.|09-10-2014|aquarius
279|You have powerful friends but for some reason you are reluctant to use them to help get you out of your current predicament. Maybe it’s because you don’t want to waste your trump cards on minor problems. You can deal with this one alone.|09-11-2014|aquarius
280|If you feel a bit drained, physically, mentally and emotionally, then you must take it as a sign that you need to slow down. A short rest now will do wonders for your energy levels during the early part of next week. Start the weekend early.|09-12-2014|aquarius
281|You hold firm opinions on lots of topics but sometimes you can be a bit too set in your ways and it prevents you from seeing other possibilities. If someone challenges your opinions today don’t hit back without thinking. They may have a point.|09-13-2014|aquarius
282|Some of the ideas you have may be inspirational, but they won’t amount to much unless you find ways of using them. If you only ever make the world a better place in one small practical way that’s better than a thousand grandiose dreams.|09-14-2014|aquarius
283|A disappointment of some sort may be hard to take but the pain will fade eventually, so don’t get too down. There are still plenty of things that inspire you, so pick one of them and throw yourself at it body, mind and soul.|09-16-2014|aquarius
284|Over the next few days you should take any and every opportunity to rest, recuperate and recharge your batteries. When the Sun changes signs on the 23rd it will be all go again, but in a good way – so save yourself for then.|09-17-2014|aquarius
285|However much you might fear the unknown you must confront it over the next few days, otherwise you may not be in the right frame of mind to take advantage of the wonderful opportunities coming your way. Show some courage – and act!|09-18-2014|aquarius
286|The answers you seek are easily found, but only if you ask the right questions in the right way. It does not matter what other people say you should be thinking or saying or doing – you’re an Aquarius, so think, speak and act big.|09-19-2014|aquarius
287|Things will really pick up for you when the Sun moves into one of the most positive areas of your chart on the 23rd. Between now and then though try to get as many chores and minor tasks as you can manage out of the way.|09-20-2014|aquarius
288|You can make things easier for yourself this week by refusing to dwell on past mistakes. What’s done is done and cannot be undone and the sooner you accept that fact the sooner you will be able to move on. It won’t be long before you’re smiling again.|09-21-2014|aquarius
289|A difficult time of year is drawing to a close and when the Sun moves in your favor tomorrow it will feel as if a load has been lifted from your back. If you need a vacation then start making plans. No one deserves it more than you.|09-22-2014|aquarius
290|You have sacrificed a great deal in recent weeks and now you are wondering if you are going to get something back in return. Don’t worry, you will. The Sun’s change of signs today will open up a world of new possibilities. Take your pick.|09-23-2014|aquarius
291|You seem to be in everyone’s good books at the moment and long may it continue. However, while it may be flattering to be so highly thought of make sure you can live up to what others expect of you. There must be substance as well as style.|09-24-2014|aquarius
292|Uranus, your ruler, is brilliantly aligned with luck planet Jupiter today, so how can you possibly lose? The answer is you can’t, so decide what it is you most want to do then give it your best shot. You’ll make a huge success of it.|09-25-2014|aquarius
293|It may not feel right that certain people have the power to force you in a certain direction but in a matter of days you will be glad it happened that way. It seems you lack the willpower to do what has to be done.|09-26-2014|aquarius
294|Any doubts you may have about the direction your career is heading should disappear over the next few days. The fact is you are still on track to reach the goals you set yourself around this time last year. Be patient – it will happen.|09-27-2014|aquarius
295|Massive changes are taking place around you and, with one or two minor exceptions, they are changes which will benefit you. With that knowledge in mind don’t be afraid to take a few chances over the next few days. You’re a winner.|09-28-2014|aquarius
296|Things might be calm on the surface but your instincts tell you that behind the scenes major changes are taking place. Don’t worry. It is all part of the bigger plan, a plan that is designed to make your life more fulfilling.|09-29-2014|aquarius
297|You have no end of talent but you need to add patience and hard work to the mix if you expect to be a success. The Sun in Libra will help you find ways to get the balance right and soon your name will be up in lights.|09-30-2014|aquarius
298|Whatever else life may be at the moment it certainly isn’t dull. The Sun in your fellow Air sign of Libra makes even mundane events seem more exciting, so no way will you be bored – and no way will you put up with boring people.|10-01-2014|aquarius
299|Everything is all right with your world at the moment, or should be. The Sun and Venus in one of the best areas of your chart means you can see the positive side, and the funny side, of most situations. Go on, have a laugh.|10-02-2014|aquarius
300|You have so much good fortune in your celestial bank account. When are you going to start spending some of it? The weekend is almost here, so forget about what you have to do and do only what you want to do. Yes, you can afford it.|10-03-2014|aquarius
301|You are under no illusions that a number of things in your life need to change and that the change must come from within. Some people may not understand why you need to move in a new direction, so explain it to them as best you can.|10-04-2014|aquarius
302|You must take responsibility for your words and actions. Because so many people look up to you there is always the danger that you might give them the wrong impression, especially when you are in one of your rebellious moods.|10-05-2014|aquarius
303|You are now in the middle of one of the most fortunate times of the year and even when things seem to go wrong they will come good in the end. With that thought in mind don’t be afraid to take a few risks. You’re unlikely to lose.|10-06-2014|aquarius

305|Trust your instincts if they lead you in a certain direction today but don’t expect other people to follow your lead without question. What is crystal clear to you may be difficult for a friend or family member to comprehend, so make allowances.|10-09-2014|aquarius
306|Something you have been dreaming about for weeks, months, maybe even years is about to become a reality. Lucky you. Not everyone will be pleased with what happens over the next 24 hours, but not everyone has as much to gain from it as you.|10-10-2014|aquarius
307|If you are smart you will take it easy this weekend. Why? Because there are some seriously big changes coming up and you will need all your mental, emotional and physical energy to deal with them. Others will need you on top of your game too.|10-11-2014|aquarius
308|A work colleague or a business partner may not be trying to cheat you as such but neither will they race to your rescue if things go wrong. You might like to think the best of your fellow human beings but you need to be more realistic for the time being.|10-12-2014|aquarius
309|Whatever else you do over the next 24 hours make sure you stay on good terms with people in positions of authority. You may be a rebel by nature but there are times when even an Aquarius must play the game and this is one of them.|10-13-2014|aquarius
310|You should be wonderfully happy today, and if you are not then clearly you are doing something wrong. This is one of the best times of the year for you but it won’t last much longer, so cheer up and love your life for what it is.|10-14-2014|aquarius
311|Today’s Sun-Mars link encourages you to be more outgoing, both on a one-to-one level with people you know intimately and with people you meet socially or at work. You may have plenty of friends already but a few more won’t hurt.|10-15-2014|aquarius
312|You know what is and is not possible and have no intention of letting daydreams and wishful thinking lead you astray. That’s good. Other people can believe in all sorts of airy-fairy nonsense if they want but you must deal only in facts.|10-16-2014|aquarius
313|There is no point complaining that things are not going the way you want them to go. Wherever you happen to be and whatever you happen to be doing at this precise moment of time is exactly right for you, so lighten up and make it work.|10-17-2014|aquarius

315|Don’t listen to those who say you should be different in some way, You don’t need to play a role to make your mark. Act in a way that feels natural to you, not in a way you feel is expected of you. Be yourself – only more so!|10-20-2014|aquarius
316|You don’t have to throw everything out and start again from scratch with nothing. On the contrary, what you need to make your life happier and more fulfilling is right there in front of you – you just need to use it in a more positive way.|10-21-2014|aquarius
317|This is the ideal time to remind an employer or someone else in a position of authority that you are special, that you are on a different, and higher, level than most of your contemporaries. Don’t let them overlook your many talents.|10-22-2014|aquarius
318|A great opportunity will arrive at just the right time, in just the right place and in just the right way over the next few days, so make sure you are ready for it. You don’t need permission to act – seize the initiative and make things happen.|10-23-2014|aquarius
319|The Sun in the area of your chart that governs your social and professional reputation makes this one of the most important times of the year. Whatever goals or objectives you have it’s time to get serious about them. Now. Immediately. This very moment.|10-24-2014|aquarius
320|Your mind may be full of big ideas but common sense should tell you that you cannot do everything at once, so choose an aim that excites you and focus on it to the exclusion of everything else. Can it work? It can if you make it.|10-25-2014|aquarius
321|What happens over the next few days may not seem like something you should be grateful for but later on you will look back and realize how fortunate you were to be forced to move in a new direction. Try not to be so set in your ways.|10-26-2014|aquarius
322|Don’t let money worries detract from what promises to be an excellent week. The simple fact is there is nothing you can do to change the situation at the moment, so put it out of your mind. There’s more to life than dollars and cents.|10-27-2014|aquarius
323|You must deliver on a promise you made a while ago, even if it means you have to change your plans or miss out on a social event you were looking forward to. Your reputation could nosedive if you fail to deliver.|10-28-2014|aquarius
324|Try not to be so driven in your pursuit of success. Be ambitious by all means but don’t lose your sense of perspective. You of all people should know there are more important things in life than fame and fortune.|10-29-2014|aquarius
325|Your mind may be bursting with big ideas but what use are they if you don’t get round to knitting them together into a coherent and workable plan? Your task for the day is to bring those big ideas down to a human level.|10-30-2014|aquarius
326|It’s okay to plan for the future in general terms but don’t try to see every step of the way ahead. Not only is it impossible but it will limit your options and make you unnecessarily anxious when, inevitably, plans have to change.|11-01-2014|aquarius
327|It may be wiser to pretend to agree with someone than to stir up trouble by pointing out the flaws in their argument. Even if you disagree with them in a friendly way they are unlikely to be happy about it. You really don’t need another argument.|11-02-2014|aquarius
328|The planets warn you have been pushing yourself too hard and need to slow down a bit. That won’t be easy with power planet Pluto so strong at the start of the week but it can and must be done. Learn to say “no” – and mean it. |11-03-2014|aquarius
329|Certain things are going out of your life and, if you are sensible, you will speed them on their way. You of all people should know that nothing stays the same forever – and that the new is invariably more rewarding than the old. |11-05-2014|aquarius
330|You can sense that a friend is not very happy but what can you do about it? The first thing, of course, is to find out why they are so ill at ease, and the only way to do that is to ask them. Be prepared for some tears!|11-07-2014|aquarius
331|You know there is something missing from you life but you are having trouble discovering exactly what it is. Maybe you should revisit beliefs that you are rejected as being “old-fashioned”. Maybe there is something to them after all.|11-08-2014|aquarius
332|You may feel that you have lost control over certain aspects of your lifestyle, and maybe you have, but is it such a big deal? The fact that other people are determined to take decisions for you frees up time to pursue more interesting ambitions.|11-10-2014|aquarius
333|Some sort of offer will come your way over the next 24 hours but you may seem reluctant to take advantage of it. Even if it involves more work than you feel able to handle you won’t know for certain until you give it a try. |11-11-2014|aquarius
334|Sometimes you have to take center stage when the cosmic script calls for it, and it is calling for it today. Don’t stay in the shadows: let everyone see who you are, what you believe in and what you can do – that’s just about anything!|11-12-2014|aquarius

339|Under no circumstances should you push yourself beyond your natural limits today. Saturn, planet of limitation, warns if you take on too much you may end up further from your long-term goal than when you started. There’s no rush.|11-18-2014|aquarius
340|A rival will try to intimidate you into doing things their way but their overly assertive attitude will annoy you and make you determined to do the opposite. Can you be sure though that it isn’t a double bluff? Maybe it’s best to do nothing at all. |11-19-2014|aquarius
341|A certain amount of caution is needed today when dealing with employers and people in positions of authority. But that does not mean you have to put up and shut up. Be subtle in your criticisms – they’re not smart enough to “get it”.|11-20-2014|aquarius
342|Keep telling yourself that you will succeed, no matter how difficult the tasks ahead of you may appear to be. The Sun’s change of signs over the weekend will make it easier to get on top of things without working yourself into the ground.|11-21-2014|aquarius
343|Your feelings for someone will surge from one extreme to the other over the next 48 hours. Try not to make any hasty decisions, otherwise you may find yourself having to backtrack madly later on, which could be rather embarrassing. |11-22-2014|aquarius
344|Don’t waste time on little things when there is one huge thing that needs your attention. You may think that by avoiding what appears to be an unpleasant duty you can put it off indefinitely but you can’t. Tackle it now and get it over with.|11-23-2014|aquarius
345|There are plenty of reasons why it might be wise to keep your head down and stay quiet but opportunities to have your say come all too rarely and you are not going to let this one pass by. Say your piece and say it loud. |11-24-2014|aquarius
346|Although Mars and Jupiter form a somewhat tense link today it could also be a useful link. It will certainly help you deal with any difficulties quickly and efficiently. You have no intention of wasting time on trivial events or trivial people. |11-25-2014|aquarius
347|If you feel the need to express yourself forcefully today then by all means do so. You have an important message to get across and if the only way to make yourself heard is to shout then do it. You have been quiet long enough. |11-26-2014|aquarius
348|A work or financial issue may be giving you problems but if you stay calm and listen to your inner voice it will guide you to the correct solution. Find a place where you can be alone with your thoughts for an hour or two.|11-27-2014|aquarius
349|There is no point dwelling on events you have no way of changing. Aquarius is supposed to be a forward-looking sign, so focus on what might be rather than on what has been. Each day is a new beginning and each day is perfect in it’s own way.|11-28-2014|aquarius
350|You may not fully understand why certain changes have to occur but your inner voice tells you that everything will work out for the best. Go with the flow over the next 48 hours – there is no danger at all that you will be swept away. |11-29-2014|aquarius
351|Mars in your birth sign from Thursday onwards will endow you with the courage and the confidence you need to try something new. You may be a free thinker by nature but how often do you actually put your thoughts into effect?|11-30-2014|aquarius
352|There is a job to be done and you know that you won’t be able to move on in your life until it is finished. Yes, of course, you don’t like to feel you are being coerced but according to the planets it’s for your own benefit. |12-01-2014|aquarius
353|You will have to make a choice between two equally desirable things today – and, no, you cannot have them both. Once you have decided what benefit you are going to embrace you must let go of the other one completely. |12-02-2014|aquarius
354|Mars, planet of energy and ambition, moves into your sign tomorrow, so start thinking about what you would like to change in your life because you will soon get the chance. What would you do if you knew you could not fail? So do it.|12-03-2014|aquarius
355|What seems such a major issue to some people is no more than an interesting sideshow to you. You’re in one of those moods when you just can’t take anything too seriously. What will be will be, and you’re happy with that.|12-04-2014|aquarius
356|You have no choice but to accept that something you have been working on is not going to be the success you envisaged. Chances are though you will be quite happy to call it a day as it frees up time for more enjoyable pursuits. |12-05-2014|aquarius
357|This should be an eventful weekend, and for all the right reasons. Creative matters are under excellent stars, so get to work on something that inspires you and trust that, when finished, it will inspire other people as well.|12-06-2014|aquarius
358|Do you stick with what you know you can make a success of or do you attempt something that will stretch you talent to the limit? Only you can answer that question but the planets dourge you to be more adventurous. |12-07-2014|aquarius
359|As Jupiter begins one of its retrograde phases today you are advised not to take anything for granted. Someone you think of as a friend may be harboring a secret grudge, so don’t go giving away secrets they could use against you. |12-08-2014|aquarius
360|Today may not be the most exciting day of your life but it will be important, not least because the motives of someone you have important dealings with will at last be clear to see. Looks like you can trust them after all. |12-09-2014|aquarius
361|For someone who is usually so confident you seem strangely thin-skinned at the moment. Could it be because you realize that some of the criticisms being leveled at you are true? Why not just admit you were wrong? It’s not the end of the world. |12-10-2014|aquarius
362|If others have power over you it is only because you have given them that power – and it is always in your power to take it back. Be forceful today but don’t be emotional about it. No one is going to say “no” to you. |12-11-2014|aquarius
363|You will hear something to your advantage today but because it is something you were not supposed to know you may be reluctant to make use of it. Don’t be. If others were stupid enough to let it slip that’s their problem, not yours.|12-12-2014|aquarius
364|You need to get back on good terms with someone you recently clashed with. Even if you believe the problem is largely their fault you must swallow your pride and say sorry. It’s a small price to pay for what you’ll get in return.|12-13-2014|aquarius
365|Disagreements are likely over the next few days and the atmosphere could turn nasty if you take what others say too seriously or too personally. Just because someone sees things from a different perspective does not make them your enemy.|12-14-2014|aquarius
366|You are determined to finish that long list of chores that has been holding you back from doing more interesting things. And that’s good because the planets indicate that the next few days are potentially some of the most creative of the year.|12-15-2014|aquarius
367|The atmosphere will be a bit tense today and that could spell trouble if you are the type of person who relieves tension by spending money. Make sure you keep all your receipts – you may want to return your more extravagant purchases tomorrow!|12-16-2014|aquarius
368|Your imaginative powers are at their height at the moment and over the next 24 hours your head will be all over the place, but in a nice way. Don’t dismiss an idea because it sounds too outrageous to be true. For you all things are possible. |12-17-2014|aquarius
369|Focus on something of a creative or artistic nature today, preferably something that you can do on your own. You may be sociable by nature but sometimes you need to spend time alone to get the best from your abilities. |12-18-2014|aquarius
370|If someone you have feelings for spends more time with others than they do with you today there is no need to get uptight. Yes, maybe they are trying to make you feel jealous, but it’s not as if you have not done it yourself.|12-19-2014|aquarius
371|To the world at large you may appear to be your usual happy-go-lucky self but deep down you are having a few doubts. That’s okay – in fact it is perfectly natural. At this time of year you tend to be negative for no good reason. It will pass. |12-20-2014|aquarius
372|Act as if you are super-confident, even if deep down you fear the worst. Most likely you are being far too negative about your prospects, so keep smiling and keep planning and keep believing that better days will come – and they will.|12-21-2014|aquarius
373|Someone you are close to emotionally is likely to do something that shocks you but you should have seen it coming. You can condemn them if you like but why not show how much they mean to you by supporting them unconditionally?|12-22-2014|aquarius
374|Don’t let others pressure you into accepting an offer you have no way of knowing is right for you. According to the planets it may sound good but could mean a lot more work for little return. Money doesn’t mean everything anyway.|12-23-2014|aquarius
375|Make the most of Mars in your sign to try something new and maybe take a few risks. You have always been the adventurous sort and now you are determined to show you have absolutely no fear. Take on the world and win. |12-24-2014|aquarius
376|Take time out today to stand back from what you are doing and see it from a wider and a higher perspective. How does it fit in to your long-term goals? How will it benefit not only yourself but other people too? Think about it, then act. |12-25-2014|aquarius
377|You like to be controversial but watch out you don’t push it a little too far today and annoy someone you should try to stay on good terms with. Don’t say things just because you know it will provoke a reaction. |12-26-2014|aquarius
378|Pay attention to what friends and family members say this weekend, even if their words are not entirely to your liking. You don’t always know best and it could be that if you take their advice you will save yourself some embarrassment. |12-27-2014|aquarius
379|There is no point being too assertive now because you will achieve more in the long-term if you co-operate rather than compete. Despite what some people may say it is not really a dog-eat-dog world – most people still prefer to be nice.|12-28-2014|aquarius
380|Be on your guard today and take nothing for granted. Yes, it’s possible you could read too much into a perfectly normal situation but rather that than you push ahead with no thought for what could go wrong. Better safe than sorry today. |12-29-2014|aquarius
381|There have been times of late when it seemed as if Lady Luck has deserted you but don’t despair because better days are coming. Stay on good terms with those you live and work with and go out and meet as many new people as possible. |12-30-2014|aquarius
382|Anyone who approaches you with a plan they insist will make you rich and famous must be politely but firmly shown the door. You don’t need other people’s plans, you have got plenty of your own – the sort of plans that mean something.|12-31-2014|aquarius
383|Whatever it is you wish for as the new year begins there is every possibility that you will get it. Your thoughts are more powerful than you realize and if you focus them on a single target it won’t be long before you reach it. |01-01-2015|aquarius
384|You don’t usually spend much time on self-analysis but today you are likely to go right the other way and shut yourself away so you can contemplate the meaning of your existence. Don’t worry, you will be back to normal soon.|01-02-2015|aquarius
385|Venus, planet of balance and harmony, moves into your birth sign today, so no matter how challenging the events of the next few weeks may be you will sail through them with the greatest of ease. Always look for the simplest solution. |01-03-2015|aquarius
386|Monday’s full moon is likely to make you rather impatient, especially on the work front where others seem unable or unwilling to act as fast as you can. Maybe though it is you who needs to slow down. Ask yourself honestly: what is the rush? |01-04-2015|aquarius
387|Do something exciting over the next 24 hours, something that makes you smile. Usually you don’t have to force it but today’s full moon means it may take a little more effort than usual. As always, it’s an effort worth making.|01-05-2015|aquarius
388|Anyone who tries to tell you what to do today will soon be wishing they had kept out of your way. You don’t want or need advice, you just want others to leave you alone – and if they have any sense that’s exactly what they will do. |01-06-2015|aquarius
389|You might be tempted to argue with someone whose opinions you find offensive but chances are they are deliberately trying to provoke you into overreacting. The best way to deal with such people is to pretend they do not exist. |01-07-2015|aquarius
390|Today’s Mercury-Neptune link warns you need to be careful with money, so keep your cash in your pocket no matter how much others insist this is the ideal time to spend. It may be for them but it isn’t for you.|01-08-2015|aquarius
391|If someone older or wiser than you offers advice today you must listen and you must think seriously about doing what they say, because it could save you a fortune. You know a lot but you cannot possibly know it all. |01-09-2015|aquarius
392|Try not to judge people whose values you do not share. With expansive Jupiter moving through your opposite sign you should find it easy to accept that people are different, although that does not mean you have to admire them.|01-10-2015|aquarius
393|Your mind is so sharp at the moment that nothing escapes its attention. Which should be useful if you are looking for ways to make money. Don’t just be the first to see new possibilities, be the first to exploit them as well. |01-11-2015|aquarius
394|Make sure you get the going rate for whatever it is you are working on at the moment. Under no circumstances sell yourself short this coming week, because the moment you do is the moment everyone starts taking advantage of you. |01-12-2015|aquarius
395|Someone who does not approve of your desire to come and go as you please will try to clip your wings today. They will only succeed if you allow them to convince you that it’s for your own good. You’re not a fool, so don’t believe it.|01-13-2015|aquarius
396|By all means have fun today but don’t go too far and put your wellbeing at risk. Even an Aquarius has limits and though your mind may think you are up to it your body may not agree. Always leave a little something in reserve. |01-14-2015|aquarius
397|Don’t push yourself too hard over the next 24 hours – in fact don’t push yourself at all. Some days were made for taking it easy and the planets indicate that this is one of them. You will be busy again come the weekend. |01-15-2015|aquarius
398|Don’t feel bad about it if you gain from someone else’s loss over the next 24 hours. According to the planets it is your turn to get lucky, so take advantage of the situation and make sure what you gain is well invested.|01-16-2015|aquarius
399|Annoying people will do trivial things this weekend and you may have to hold your breath and count to ten so you don’t lose your temper. Stay calm but stay focused too. Unlike them, you have important issues to deal with.|01-17-2015|aquarius
400|As the Sun moves into your birth sign on Tuesday you must put all the negative things that have happened behind you and focus on a new start. Each day is a new beginning and any day can be the best day ever.|01-18-2015|aquarius
401|You won’t care in the slightest what anyone thinks about you today – in fact you will be quite pleased if they think the worst! You are determined to show that you will follow your own path through life, even if no one supports you. |01-19-2015|aquarius
402|A little bit of effort will go a long way over the next 24 hours, not least because with the Sun moving into your birth sign you will be extremely positive in your outlook. All things are possible if you desire them enough. |01-20-2015|aquarius
403|Sometimes it’s okay to be suspicious and this is one of those occasions. If your sixth sense tells you to take care then you should be smart and listen to them. Yes, maybe your mind is playing tricks on you but why take the chance? |01-21-2015|aquarius
404|If you want someone to do you a favor then you are going to have to flatter them, even though you know they don’t deserve it. Some days you can speak your mind but today you should keep your real thoughts to yourself.|01-22-2015|aquarius
405|You don’t have to fight to get what you need. On the contrary, you will get everything you desire over the next two or three days simply by appealing to other people’s generosity. You’re the kind of person others want to do favors for.|01-23-2015|aquarius
406|Don’t try too hard to please other people over the next 48 hours. The simple fact is they should be trying to please you, seeing as you are the one with the ideas and the energy and the vision of the future that inspires. |01-24-2015|aquarius
407|Venus, planet of love, leaves your sign on Tuesday, so if you need to let someone know how you feel then tell them right now. Also, a friend’s money-making idea may sound too good to be true but look into it anyway. |01-25-2015|aquarius
408|The message of the stars this week is simple and to the point: don’t get carried away by your own enthusiasms. You will get your chance to shine – in fact you will get several – but pushing too hard could be counter-productive. |01-26-2015|aquarius
409|You will get more than one opportunity to shine today, and you could make some money too. The only danger is you could be too trusting and agree to back someone financially when there are no guarantees you will see your cash again.|01-27-2015|aquarius
410|According to the planets you are wasting time and energy fantasizing about things that are never going to happen. Today’s Mercury-Uranus link demands that you bring your dreams down to earth. Not even an Aquarius can do the impossible. |01-28-2015|aquarius
411|The world is full of possibilities and each and every one of those possibilities is there for you to make use of. Others may say that certain things cannot be done but you must ignore them all and follow your dream. |01-29-2015|aquarius
412|You may feel unprepared for the challenges that are coming your way but when it’s time to act you will do so with courage and confidence. You may be a nice guy by nature but you can be decisive, even ruthless, when the need arises.|01-30-2015|aquarius
413|Don’t let other people hurry you along this weekend. Keep moving ahead at your own sweet pace and everything that has to get done will get done. More importantly, it will get done correctly. Someone has to keep standards high. |01-31-2015|aquarius
414|No effort will be too much for you over the next few days. Whatever goal you have in your sights now will be reached by the end of the week. If anyone is foolish enough to stand in your way they won’t be standing for long!|02-01-2015|aquarius
415|There is nothing you cannot do, no challenge you cannot handle. If you are a typical Aquarius you will seek out situations that test you to the limit over the next few days. You don’t need to prove yourself but you will do so anyway. |02-02-2015|aquarius
416|You cannot expect loved ones to help with the things you want to do today – in fact they are likely to be downright obstructive. But don’t get upset because tomorrow they will make it up to you and do whatever you ask of them. |02-03-2015|aquarius
417|You are in a determined and dynamic mood at the moment and anyone who thinks they are tough enough to take you on is making a big mistake. You know what you want and there is not the slightest doubt that you will get it.|02-04-2015|aquarius
418|There are some thoughts that should always be kept to yourself. The danger today is that you could say something on the spur of the moment and get yourself in a whole load of trouble with people in positions of power. |02-05-2015|aquarius
419|You may find it hard to get along with people in positions of authority today but if you take them on you are likely to lose. There are times when it is better to back down gracefully and this is one of them.|02-06-2015|aquarius
420|If you need to change certain methods or routines you can do so quite easily over the next 48 hours. But don’t make a big deal of it and don’t try to do it all in one go. Think evolution, not revolution.|02-07-2015|aquarius
421|You won’t need anyone’s advice or assistance this week – you know exactly what you should be doing and when Mercury turns direct again on Wednesday you will waste no time getting on with it. Success is now within touching distance. |02-08-2015|aquarius
422|If the plans you made a month or two back don’t seem to be working out the way you intended, junk them today and start again. The sooner you start making changes the sooner your confidence will grow. You have got to be bold. |02-09-2015|aquarius
423|Someone’s dishonesty may shock you today but you only have yourself to blame. The signs have been there for quite some time but you chose to ignore them. Now the question is: what are you going to do about it? |02-10-2015|aquarius
424|Something that has gone wrong on several occasions over the past two or three weeks will start going right again as from today, which in turn will lead to a much improved outlook on your part. It’s all good.|02-11-2015|aquarius
425|This is a good time for all forms of communication, and whether you pick up a pen or pick up a phone others will be delighted to hear from you. An old friend you have not talked to in a while will have some remarkable news. |02-12-2015|aquarius
426|Now that Mercury, planet of the mind, is moving in your favor again your head should be full of ideas. Take the initiative and start something new but make sure it is sensible and pragmatic, something that is likely to work.|02-13-2015|aquarius
427|Someone you think the world of will say or do something that disappoints you this weekend but don’t let it undermine your friendship. Let them know you are not amused but let them know too that you forgive them – this time.|02-14-2015|aquarius
428|You’ve had a lot of fun in recent weeks while the Sun has been transiting your birth sign, and there is no reason why the fun should not continue after the Sun moves on in midweek. Keep track though of how much it costs you. |02-15-2015|aquarius
429|You readily come to the aid of individuals who need help but if you are serious about making a difference in the world you should join with others in some kind of social or political cause. You can do more together than you do alone. |02-16-2015|aquarius
430|Take care you don’t waste money on things you don’t really need. It’s up to you what you do with your cash, of course, but surely you can find something better to spend it on, something that brings long-term benefits to you and yours. |02-17-2015|aquarius
431|It will pay you to be friendly to everyone you meet today, even those who have not always been friendly to you in the past. Your most pressing concern now is to make some extra money, so you need to get along with people. |02-18-2015|aquarius
432|Be careful what you wish for over the next 24 hours because you may get more than you expected. You may decide later that you don’t want what you wished for after all – but you won’t be allowed to change your mind. |02-19-2015|aquarius
433|Social activities will be a lot of fun over the next few days but there will be challenges too. Someone you meet while on the move could rub you up the wrong way over something trivial but it’s really no big deal, so don’t overreact.|02-20-2015|aquarius
434|You will find it ridiculously easy to get what you want this weekend – you have rarely been so persuasive. But remember that if someone does you a favor there will come a time when you have to do something for them in return.|02-21-2015|aquarius
435|Chances are you will want to relax and not take life too seriously this week, so make sure your affairs are in order so you don’t have to keep checking up on them. Then you can enjoy yourself with a clear conscience. |02-22-2015|aquarius
436|Stay out of a dispute today, even if you think you can bring the two sides together. Chances are you will bring them together but it is likely to be in opposition to you! There’s only one side that matters – your own side. |02-23-2015|aquarius
437|According to the planets you are desperate to make an impression and will do just about anything to make the world sit up and take notice. But don’t break the rules or, worse, break the law. The impression must be positive, not negative.|02-24-2015|aquarius
438|Don’t let money worries stop you from doing what you find enjoyable today. There are times when you should watch what you spend and times when you should splash out and have some fun – and this is one of the latter. |02-25-2015|aquarius
439|The only danger today is that you might say too much and tip off a rival about what you are up to. Be wary if they try to engage you in personal conversation as it suggests they are looking for ways to undermine your efforts.|02-26-2015|aquarius
440|A friend or relative will tell you something you don’t want to hear today, not least because it involves bad things about a person you like. Most likely their motive is to drive a wedge between you. They will only succeed if you let them.|02-27-2015|aquarius
441|You have to decide whether to continue with a project you have invested a lot of time and energy in or whether to ditch it and start something new. Only you can make that decision but there can be no going back, so give it some serious thought.|02-28-2015|aquarius
442|If you let others do things for you this week there is a good chance they will mess it up, so get your act together and do it yourself. What you have to do may be a chore but it still has to be done, and done well. |03-01-2015|aquarius
443|You need to make your peace with someone you fell out with a week or two ago. There is no point ignoring each other, not when your lives are so closely entwined, so get over your disagreement and focus on what is important. |03-02-2015|aquarius
444|Someone wants to repay you for all the kindness you have shown. It was no big deal as far as you are concerned but it will make them feel good to do you a favor, so drop a few hints as to how they can help you.|03-03-2015|aquarius
445|Yes, you can turn your dreams into realities – all you have to do is believe in yourself. With Uranus, your ruler, linked to values planet Venus today you only have to put a name to your desires to see them come true.|03-04-2015|aquarius
446|You may have some amazing ideas running through your head at the moment but don’t be too eager to do anything with them. This is more a time for thinking than doing, both in your private life and in your work.|03-05-2015|aquarius
447|You want to do something one way but everyone else wants to do it another way – yes, you have been here before. Just get on and do what you feel is right and most people will come round to your way of thinking.|03-06-2015|aquarius
448|It may annoy you that a friend seems to be taking too deep an interest in your personal affairs but it is from the best of intentions. If you really don’t want their advice then fine, let them know, but don’t let it come between you.|03-07-2015|aquarius
449|You will say something this week that sounds scandalous to those who are not used to being talked to in such an abrupt way. They will soon learn that they should only come to you for advice if they are prepared to hear the unvarnished truth.|03-08-2015|aquarius
450|Your mind will have to work hard this week, so don’t do anything too strenuous physically. Having said that, you will need to take a break from your mental gymnastics once in a while and a brisk walk will help. But don’t run! |03-09-2015|aquarius
451|Do something today that takes others by surprise. It does not have to be shocking or outrageous but it does have to remind those you live, work and do business with that you should never be taken for granted – not without consequences, anyway.|03-10-2015|aquarius
452|You can get almost anything you desire now. Your charm levels are such that few people will be able to deny you, no matter how outrageous some of your demands might be. It won’t be this good again for a while, so take advantage!|03-11-2015|aquarius
453|You will have to re-think certain ambitions over the next two or three days. New information will come to light that makes you realize there is a lot more work involved than you imagined. But that’s okay because no one works harder than you.|03-12-2015|aquarius
454|The message of the stars today is that happiness comes from wanting what you have, not having what you want. You have more than enough to satisfy your basic needs, so be thankful and look for ways to help those less fortunate than yourself. |03-13-2015|aquarius
455|You must keep your thoughts positive this weekend, even though a series of negative events makes it easy to worry. Most likely you personally have nothing to fear, so approach life in a light-hearted manner and expect the best, not the worst. |03-14-2015|aquarius
456|Someone in a position of power will make you an offer during the first half of the week but you are advised not to commit yourself to anything new until the Sun changes signs on the 20th. What’s the rush? You’re the one in demand.|03-15-2015|aquarius
457|You feel remarkably confident at the moment and that’s good, but don’t go too far and say or do something that risks making an enemy of people who are way beyond you in the power stakes. You want them on your side, not against you. |03-16-2015|aquarius
458|You have been unusually quiet of late but when the Sun changes signs on the 20th you will find your voice again. You certainly don’t lack for opinions, and you will have a few more to add to them by the end of the week.|03-17-2015|aquarius
459|If there is something you don’t want the world to know about you must keep it strictly to yourself – don’t let even your best friend in on the secret. Once you tell one person it won’t be long before everyone knows about it.|03-18-2015|aquarius
460|You may be disappointed to discover that something of value is moving out of your life but don’t feel too sorry for yourself. The planets suggest that something even better will soon be along to fill the gap. Be ready for it.|03-19-2015|aquarius
461|Now that the Sun is moving into one of the more sociable, and talkative, areas of your chart you won’t have any problems putting across your point of view. The only danger is you may say it all today and have nothing left for tomorrow. |03-20-2015|aquarius
462|The more you are on the move this weekend the more you will learn. The Sun in Aries at this time of year is good for all kinds of communication, so let others know what you are thinking and encourage them to be honest with you too. |03-21-2015|aquarius
463|You will learn something to your advantage today, but whether or not you actually make use of it remains to be seen. If you don’t then someone else will and one day you may look back and wish you had taken the risk. |03-22-2015|aquarius
464|You may be adventurous by nature but others are reluctant to take risks at the moment and if you are smart you will follow their example. Try not to expose yourself to situations that could become difficult, or even dangerous. |03-23-2015|aquarius
465|Venus in the domestic area of your chart means that family affairs will go remarkably smoothly over the next few days. If there have been any minor disputes or disagreements now is the time to sit down together and sort them out.|03-24-2015|aquarius
466|You may be in a fun-loving mood at the moment but you also have serious things to consider, things that must be dealt with now. Focus all your attention and energy on them today – and tomorrow you can party with a clear conscience. |03-25-2015|aquarius
467|You may like to pretend that you are self-sufficient and don’t need assistance but you need to be honest with yourself today. If you don’t get help with what is bothering you it will get worse, so forget about your ego for a while.|03-26-2015|aquarius
468|This is a good day to patch up disputes with loved ones. You will find it much easier than usual to admit that you were at least partly to blame for what went wrong – and that will make it easier for others to admit their failings as well.|03-27-2015|aquarius
469|You will get the chance to do a good deed for someone this week but it is the kind of good deed that only you will know about. That warm feeling you get inside is more than enough reward – you don’t need public recognition. |03-29-2015|aquarius
470|If you don’t tell the absolute truth about yourself today you will regret it later in the week when your evasive tactics are revealed for the world to see. Why should you worry what others know about you? Put everything in the public domain.|03-30-2015|aquarius
471|You may have to get tough with friends and colleagues today but if it is the only way to get things done then what choice do you have? Talk the talk, walk the walk and make sure others do their fair share as well.  |03-31-2015|aquarius
472|Don’t stick your nose in someone else’s business today unless they expressly ask you to do so. Partners and colleagues are a bit touchy at the moment, so even if your intentions are noble don’t try to run their affairs for them.|04-01-2015|aquarius
473|Your confidence in your own abilities has always been high but today it will be on a different level to everyone else. The Sun’s link with Jupiter means you no longer know what the word “cannot” means. You can do anything.|04-02-2015|aquarius
474|There will be times over the next few days when you feel like giving up on something but you must overcome that negativity and carry on. One big push will take you over the finishing line, so take a deep breath and get on with it.|04-03-2015|aquarius
475|A difference of opinion over something trivial could escalate into a full-blown war of words and that would be a shame because this is a great time for having fun socially. Don’t take anything too seriously over the next 48 hours.|04-04-2015|aquarius
476|The Sun’s link with Uranus, your ruler, on Monday means you will have plenty to say this week. And no one will be able to claim they cannot understand what it is you are trying to tell them – your message will be short and to the point!|04-05-2015|aquarius
477|You are in one of your generous moods at the moment, which is nice, but make sure it is only those who deserve your largesse who get it. Hangers-on will happily enjoy themselves at your expense if you let them – so don’t let them!|04-06-2015|aquarius
478|You may have a right to be angry that someone has let you down but try not to go over the top about it. The most important thing you have is your reputation for fairness and logical thinking – don’t risk it over something trivial.|04-07-2015|aquarius
479|You have no option now but to accept that partners and colleagues have the upper hand. But you can plan ahead and you can look forward to a time when you are back in control. That time may be closer than you think.|04-08-2015|aquarius
480|You won’t find it difficult to get what you want today but don’t forget if someone makes you a loan there will come a time when you have to pay it back. Think ahead before you risk getting yourself further in debt.|04-09-2015|aquarius
481|You may be sad that something, or someone, is going out of your life but don’t shed too many tears. The good news is that once you have made a space then something, or someone, even better will come along to fill it.|04-10-2015|aquarius
482|You may have been a bit cold romantically of late but with Venus moving into the most dynamic area of your chart this weekend your true feelings will come to the surface. You will leave certain people in no doubt that you love them.|04-11-2015|aquarius
483|This is an excellent time to communicate your feelings, especially if you are the kind of Aquarius who values emotional self-control. You will find the right words to get your message across without running the risk of getting excitable.|04-12-2015|aquarius
484|Your attitude towards a belief or opinion you had previously dismissed as ridiculous will change over the next 24 hours. Something will happen to make you wonder if maybe it was you who got it wrong. You’re not infallible after all. |04-13-2015|aquarius
485|A domestic issue that has been bugging you for some time can and must be dealt with today. The answer to the problem will appear in your mind seemingly out of nowhere and once it does don’t wait or think about it – just act.|04-14-2015|aquarius
486|Venus in your fellow Air sign of Gemini will do wonders for your confidence over the next few days but with Saturn strong at the moment as well you there will still be challenges. Remember, it’s about intelligence, not brute strength.|04-15-2015|aquarius
487|Don’t let anyone tell you that certain things cannot be done. What seems difficult, maybe even impossible, at this moment in time will become much easier when the Sun changes signs on Monday. Life never stands still and neither should you. |04-17-2015|aquarius
488|Let yourself go and have some fun over the next 48 hours. You have been far too self-controlled in recent weeks and it has begun to have a less than positive effect on your behavior. In a nutshell: stop taking life so seriously.|04-18-2015|aquarius
489|A certain individual has annoyed you once too often and now you intend to cut them out of your life. Don’t let your tender heart change your mind yet again – be ruthless about it and make sure they know your relationship is finally over. |04-19-2015|aquarius
490|Something will grab your attention today and you will be focused on it to the exclusion of everything else. Remember though that other people exist as well. Weigh up what your actions might mean to friends and loves ones.|04-20-2015|aquarius
491|Friends may know you need assistance but they won’t lift a finger to help you unless you ask them to. That may annoy you a bit but most likely it’s your own fault. They’ve been told off before for interfering in your affairs.|04-21-2015|aquarius
492|You will have words with a friend today and those words may have to be harsh. The fact is they have stepped over the line and need to be reminded they have obligations that cannot be ignored. Make sure they do the right thing.|04-22-2015|aquarius
493|Don’t be surprised if you feel a bit moody today, even though most things in your life appear to be going well at the moment. Come the weekend you will be back to your best: lively, loving and laughing hugely at the absurdities of life.|04-23-2015|aquarius
494|You won’t be content to sit back and watch the world go by today – you will be out there doing things that get you noticed. However, make sure you get noticed for the right reasons – you don’t want the powers that be on your case. |04-24-2015|aquarius
495|You will find it easy to persuade others to see things your way this weekend: you have a way with words that few can resist. But use this talent sparingly. Think of it as finite in nature – the more you use the less you have left. |04-25-2015|aquarius
496|Be careful what you say over the next few days because your words may come across as unnecessarily harsh, even if that is not your intention. People tend to respond better to kind words and encouragement than to threats and slurs. |04-26-2015|aquarius
497|If someone promises you the world and fails to deliver today you will no doubt be angry, but you should be at least as angry with yourself as you are with them. You knew they were aiming too high and you should have told them.|04-27-2015|aquarius
498|The fact that you seem to be the odd one out is not cause for concern. More than any other sign Aquarius likes to think and act against the grain – it’s what makes you special. It’s when you think and act like everyone else you need to worry.|04-28-2015|aquarius
499|Your thoughts may be mainly on your work at the moment but you must not neglect matters closer to home. Cosmic activity in the domestic area of your chart means you must make time for those you love. Lots of time!|04-29-2015|aquarius
500|It does not matter how many things have gone wrong in the past, the things that really matter will start to go right as from tomorrow when mind planet Mercury moves in your favor. Believe that life is worth living – and it will be.|04-30-2015|aquarius
501|Don’t worry if your confidence has been a bit low in recent weeks because as from today you will be much more positive about your long-term prospects. It’s always a great time to be you, but now more so than ever.|05-01-2015|aquarius
502|No matter how exciting colleagues and employers make something sound this weekend the planets warn you should give it a miss. If they manage to persuade you to help them out you could find yourself doing most of the work. |05-02-2015|aquarius
503|You are in no mood to play safe and that’s good because cosmic activity in the early part of the week will shake things up and, in doing so, create new opportunities. Keep your ideas simple – you don’t have to be a genius every day. |05-03-2015|aquarius
504|Don’t sit back and wait for good things to happen – get out into the world and make them happen. The fact that you feel dissatisfied with your lot means that changes need to be made, and ultimately only you can make them. |05-04-2015|aquarius
505|You will clash with someone today who is as different to you as it is possible to get. Don’t waste time trying to find some common ground between you – it does not exist – just say or do what you must and then move on.|05-05-2015|aquarius
506|You may be thinking of starting something new but would it not make more sense to finish what you started a while back first? Today’s powerful Sun-Pluto link will help you knuckle down and get the job done – finally! |05-06-2015|aquarius
507|You won’t hesitate to help someone in need today but the planets warn that the tale of woe you hear is only half of the story. Be that as it may you are not the sort to let them suffer, not even if they brought it on themselves.|05-07-2015|aquarius
508|You of all people should know that personal feelings should never be allowed to interfere with the facts, and the fact of the matter now is that the person who is giving you so much grief is more foolish than malicious. Don’t be too hard on them.|05-08-2015|aquarius
509|You don’t have to be pushy to get ahead. You have natural charm and a wonderful ability to make people seem special and if you make use of that ability this weekend you will get everything you desire, and make others feel good as well. |05-09-2015|aquarius
510|There can be no half measures now: you must go all out to get whatever it is you desire. With Mars moving into the most dynamic area of your chart this week few will dare stand against you – and they won’t be standing for long! |05-10-2015|aquarius
511|This is an excellent time for partnerships and affairs of the heart. Let those who mean something to you know how much you respect and care for them. If you have not been emotionally expressive of late you will make up for it today. |05-11-2015|aquarius
512|All things are possible now that Mars, planet of ambition, is moving through the most decisive area of your chart. But just because all things are possible does not mean you have to try everything. Be selective in your endeavors.|05-12-2015|aquarius
513|You can quite easily turn a setback into something more positive, simply by asking other people to help you out. What looks like a disaster to you may look quite different to them, so ask them what they see and act on what they tell you.|05-13-2015|aquarius
514|Family and financial issues need to be dealt with fast, before they get even more tangled. The Sun’s move into your fellow Air sign of Gemini next week suggests fun times – but only if you are free of unnecessary commitments.|05-14-2015|aquarius
515|With Jupiter moving through the partnership area of your chart you need only click your fingers for others to come running. What have you done to deserve being treated so well? Who knows, but make the most of it – it won’t last.|05-15-2015|aquarius
516|Be careful what you say over the next 48 hours because if your words are anything less than 100 percent accurate it could cause you a lot of trouble. There is no point bending the truth, not even to spare the feelings of a friend or colleague.|05-16-2015|aquarius
517|The upcoming new moon urges you to focus on home and family matters over the next few days. If there have been disputes or disagreements of any kind they can now be resolved with the minimum of fuss. Get to it. |05-17-2015|aquarius
518|If you need to resolve a crisis of some sort on the home front now is the time to bring everyone together to discuss what needs to be done. Don’t let things get overheated emotionally. Keep a cool head at all times. |05-18-2015|aquarius
519|It will pay you to keep a low profile today. Nothing bad is likely to happen if you stick your head above the parapet but the planets warn that calling attention to yourself could result in extra chores you really don’t want to do.|05-19-2015|aquarius
520|One of the best times of the year is about to begin and when the Sun changes signs tomorrow there will be no stopping you. Just remember to pause and enjoy the moment once in a while. Live in the present, not the past or the future.|05-20-2015|aquarius
521|The negative frame of mind you have been laboring under in recent weeks will disappear either today or tomorrow and everything will be sweetness and light again. Well, almost. You will still have to deal with one or two annoying people.|05-21-2015|aquarius
522|The planets indicate you could fall for someone today or over the weekend who, to say the least, is not really suitable. Have a fling if you must but don’t expect the relationship to last – chances are it will end as quickly as it began. |05-22-2015|aquarius
523|You will find it hard to decide if your glass is half full or half empty this weekend. You are more likely to look on the bright side if you focus on the things you are going to do, rather than the things you should not have done! |05-23-2015|aquarius
524|Your mind will be full of big ideas over the next few days but are they as good as you claim they are? With mind planet Mercury moving retrograde now you are advised to be careful – don’t get carried away by your own sense of genius.|05-24-2015|aquarius
525|Take it slow and easy as the new week begins. Things will generally go well for you but they will go even better if you make it a priority to patch up your differences with someone you work with. Laugh with each other, not at each other.|05-25-2015|aquarius
526|Can you believe what a friend or relative says? It may sound outrageous but according to the planets they could be telling you the truth. What do your instincts tell you? Your immediate gut reaction is likely to be the right one. |05-26-2015|aquarius
