0|However much you may wish to avoid any kind of unpleasantness you should not do so at the expense of your own self-esteem. If you show signs of weakness the only thing you can be sure of is that someone will take advantage.|12-01-2013|capricorn
1|Generally you take people as you find them and don’t care where they are coming from or where they are going to. Today though you should check all credentials before getting involved in anything of a financial nature.|12-02-2013|capricorn
2|There is no point trying to hide your feelings because others can see how you are hurting. What they don’t understand though is why you are hurting. If you need help – and you do – then you really must be honest with them. |12-03-2013|capricorn
3|Act rationally in everything you do today, even if it gets you a reputation as someone who is all head and no heart. Experience has taught you that people who follow only their emotions usually end up with nothing worth having.|12-04-2013|capricorn
4|It may seem as if you are being held back by circumstances beyond your control but is that true? According to the planets it’s just as likely you are putting mental obstacles in your path that have no reason being there. Sort your mind out. |12-05-2013|capricorn
5|Close your ears to criticism and don’t waste time trying to get even with those who have let you down or said hurtful things – they’re not worth the effort. Time is too precious to waste on petty people and personal vendettas.|12-06-2013|capricorn
6|Mars, planet of action and energy, crosses the career angle of your chart this weekend, so you will be even more go-getting than usual. Before beginning something new though try finishing a project that you only recently started.|12-07-2013|capricorn
7|You seem determined to see the worst in every situation – and you need to get over it quickly. Your happiness depends entirely on the way you choose to look at events – and the good news is that is wholly under your control. |12-08-2013|capricorn
8|Someone you work or do business with has been taking liberties of late and you are almost at the point where you have to say something rude. Think carefully before you open your mouth though. Do you really want to start a war?|12-09-2013|capricorn
9|Make sure you deal only with people who are exciting and original today. Some of their ideas may be a little way out for your more traditional tastes but no matter: they will spur you on to try a few creative tricks of your own.|12-10-2013|capricorn
10|You may not have made as much progress on the work front as your talents deserve but with Mars moving through the career area of your chart it won’t be long before the picture changes. You’ve got to be more assertive.|12-11-2013|capricorn
11|You would dearly like to help someone who is struggling but you know if you do they will struggle even more in the future. This is one of those situations where they need to learn from their own mistakes, painful though that may be for you both.|12-12-2013|capricorn
12|There is a danger that your frustration will get the better of you and you will say or do something that gets you noticed for the wrong sort of reason. But at least others will be aware that you’re not afraid to hit back at provocation.|12-13-2013|capricorn
13|You have always been ambitious but over the next two or three days you will amaze even yourself by your desire to move up in the world. Whatever restrictions you feel life has imposed on you just throw them off and be brilliant.|12-14-2013|capricorn
14|Stand back and let other people take center stage this weekend, especially on the work front where the further away you are from a project the less likely it is you will get part of the blame when, inevitably, it all goes wrong.|12-15-2013|capricorn
15|You don’t lack for ideas at the moment but you seem strangely reluctant to let the world know about them. Maybe that’s not such a bad thing. You don’t want rivals stealing your insights before you get the chance to exploit them yourself.|12-16-2013|capricorn
16|Don’t waste your time arguing about something that is trivial in the extreme. If you find yourself losing your temper with someone who refuses to see sense just turn your back and walk away. That will hurt them much more.|12-17-2013|capricorn
17||12-18-2013|capricorn
18|When the Sun moves into your sign this weekend a new solar year begins. Make it your objective, today and tomorrow, to look back over the past 12 months and learn what you can from your mistakes. After that it’s full speed ahead. |12-19-2013|capricorn
19|It would appear that in your haste to get ahead you have overlooked some small but important detail and if you don’t recognize that fact soon it will come back to slap you in the face. Identify your mistake, put it right and move on.|12-20-2013|capricorn
20|The Sun moves into your sign today, so put the past behind you and start with a clean slate. What’s done is done and cannot be undone, so be positive in word and deed and aim to be the very best you can be right here and now.|12-21-2013|capricorn
21|You must define your goals clearly. You must also keep them within realistic bounds. If you can do those two simple things then what you achieve over the next 12 months will overshadow what you achieved in the previous 12 years. It’s your time to shine.|12-22-2013|capricorn
22|No matter how many rivals oppose you and no matter how much they threaten to disrupt your plans you must hold your nerve. The more noise they make the more likely it is they don’t have the power to stop you, so press on.|12-23-2013|capricorn
23|Decide what is the most important thing you should be doing right now and do it to the exclusion of everything else. The Sun and Mercury in your sign makes it easy for you to focus on essentials. Your efforts will not be wasted.|12-24-2013|capricorn
24|Cosmic activity that cuts across the domestic and career angles of your chart urges you to get the family-work balance right. It also suggests you need to delegate more. You don’t have to do every last thing yourself you know.|12-25-2013|capricorn
25|As cosmic activity in your sign reaches a peak over the new year period you will have to deal with situations that in the past you have tried to avoid. The good news is solutions can easily be found, but you’ve got to act now.|12-26-2013|capricorn
26|This is a time to relax and have fun with family and friends. The planets suggest you can do as you please and get away with it today, so do nothing or do everything – the only cosmic demand is that you do it with a smile.|12-27-2013|capricorn
27|This is potentially a wonderful weekend for you, so make the most of it and make sure you get your way whatever it is you are planning to do. With so much great cosmic activity in and around your sign you really can’t lose.|12-28-2013|capricorn
28|You will have tons of ideas over the next 12 months and some of them will be touched by genius. However, your birthday chart warns that others are so far out in the universe they have no hope of coming true. Try to keep your imaginings within reasonable bounds|12-29-2013|capricorn
29|You don’t lack courage or confidence, so why are you not using them to the full? Maybe it’s because you can sense that Wednesday’s new moon will bring a brilliant new opportunity your way. Is that what you are saving yourself for?|12-30-2013|capricorn
30|You’ve been hugely ambitious of late and with mind planet Mercury joining forces with Pluto in your sign today you will be even more determined to make your mark. If you know what you want, no power on Earth can stop you from getting it. |12-31-2013|capricorn
31|Not only is there a new moon in your sign today but Pluto, planet of power, is on your side as well, so you won’t have any trouble getting your way. Both at home and at work people will go out of their way to do things for you.|01-01-2014|capricorn
32|You don’t need to make drastic changes over the coming 12 months but you do need to be sure in your own mind what it is you are hoping to accomplish. Write down in a notebook your top five aims for the year ahead and carry it with you every single day.|01-02-2014|capricorn
33|Try not to live in the past or lament your mistakes, because what happens next will more than make up for what you appear to have lost. Resolve to always look forward and never look back. It’s not nearly as hard as it sounds.|01-03-2014|capricorn
34|Don’t be surprised if you get a bit emotional over the next 48 hours. With the Sun in your sign opposing Jupiter in Cancer, you have bottled up your feelings for too long — and now they’re going to explode. These things happen.|01-04-2014|capricorn
35|Whatever it is that separates the winners from the losers you’ve got plenty, but are you using it to best effect? Your birthday chart urges you to get serious about changing your life for the better – and you might just change the world as well|01-05-2014|capricorn
36|It is important that you tell the truth today, even if by doing so you cause yourself, and maybe others, a certain amount of grief. With communications planet Mercury linked to your ruler Saturn this is clearly the time for straight talk.|01-06-2014|capricorn
37|Make the coming 12 months a time of consolidation. Make sure everything you have achieved over the past two years is safe and cannot be dismantled. Above all, enjoy all the good things that make life so special. No one deserves them more than you. |01-07-2014|capricorn
38|You must not allow anyone, not even your nearest and dearest, to hold you back from doing what you know is right for you personally. You have reached some kind of crossroads and now a decision has to be made. Inevitably, some people won’t like it.|01-08-2014|capricorn
39|If you have fallen out with someone lately now is the time to kiss and make up. That applies to all kinds of relationships but mainly to those of a personal nature. It might not be such a good idea kissing your boss, after all!|01-09-2014|capricorn
40|Start something new, something exciting, something adventurous, something that helps you make your mark on the world. Don’t worry that certain people might not approve – it’s a sure sign that you are doing something worthwhile.|01-10-2014|capricorn
41||01-11-2014|capricorn
42|You have a great many plans for the coming 12 months and it is important that you let friends and loved ones know what you will be up to. If you go off at a tangent without warning they may think they no longer have a special relationship with you. Reassure them.|01-12-2014|capricorn
43|You have accomplished so much in recent months that you may be afraid to take any more risks in case you lose what you have gained. Don’t worry, you won’t. The cosmic omens are all in your favor, so set your sights even higher this year.|01-13-2014|capricorn
44|It’s good that you know your own mind but you also need to make sure those you live and work with know it as well. Spell out what it is you expect of them now and you will get it before the Sun leaves your sign on the 20th.|01-14-2014|capricorn
45|Keep things simple and don’t let your emotions get the better of you over the next couple of days. Others can rush about like it’s the end of the world if they want but you will remain cool and calm and with full self-control.|01-15-2014|capricorn
46|You will get the chance to put various relationships on a firmer footing over the coming year and you must take full advantage of it. Whatever your current differences may be they can and must be resolved. It’s better to work together than to worry alone.|01-16-2014|capricorn
47|Your instincts rarely let you down but the planets warn you could easily be fooled by someone who knows how to play on your insecurities. Don’t fall for their lies and do something silly – if you do you will have only yourself to blame.|01-17-2014|capricorn
48|You have been far too secretive in recent months and need to be more open about who you are and what you expect from life in the year ahead. Family and friends are there for you, so let them know what you need and don’t be surprised when you get it.|01-18-2014|capricorn
49|Stay on good terms with employers and other people in prominent positions, because what you achieve – and how much you earn – over the next 12 months is not entirely in your own hands. In never hurts to have too many friends, especially powerful ones.|01-19-2014|capricorn
50|The Sun is moving into the area of your chart that governs material things such as money and possessions – which means it is time to consolidate the gains you have made since the start of the year. Fortunately, you are not the sort to give anything away.|01-20-2014|capricorn
51|If you need financial assistance now is the time to ask for it. The planets make it easy to convince those who can help that your cause is deserving. Having said which, their assistance will not come cheap, so help yourself as much as you can.|01-21-2014|capricorn
52|You are trying hard to deny your feelings for someone because you fear it might damage your reputation and maybe even harm you financially. Who knows, maybe it will, but is that really a good enough excuse to turn your back on affection?|01-22-2014|capricorn
53|Don’t worry if you have not yet begun work on a scheme that means a lot to you. In fact the longer you leave it the more likely it is to be a success. Good ideas need time to develop. You’ll know when the time is right to act.|01-23-2014|capricorn
54|You may be desperate to be doing something more exciting with your life but don’t get so desperate that you act without thinking. If you do, and make a mistake, it will most likely hit you where it hurts most – in your wallet!|01-24-2014|capricorn
55|Something you thought you understood perfectly now baffles you but there is no reason to be disheartened because the knowledge you appear to have lost will come back to you in a flash of inspiration this weekend. Keep thinking.|01-25-2014|capricorn
56|Uranus, planet of genius, will help you find clever solutions to difficult problems, but you must be adaptable. If you are one of those stubborn Capricorns who expects others to change while you stay the same your problems will stay as they are.|01-26-2014|capricorn
57|Try to be less suspicious when dealing with people on a professional level. That kind of attitude is self-fulfilling. If you think everyone is a shark then that is the kind of person you are going to attract. Come to think of it, how do others see you?|01-27-2014|capricorn
58|It may seem as if you are at the mercy of events and all you can do is go with the flow but is that the right sort of attitude? You’re a Capricorn. You’re supposed to make things happen. Show you have not lost your leadership potential.|01-28-2014|capricorn
59|Help partners and loved ones feel as good about themselves as you feel about yourself. That may be no easy task, but it can be done, and it must be done because happiness at home is essential to so many other things.|01-29-2014|capricorn
60|Chances are Lady Luck will smile on you today – good things will come your way without you having to do very much to attract them. Having said which, don’t give away any personal information and don’t try too hard. Just let it happen.|01-30-2014|capricorn
61|You will find it easy enough to get your way over the next 24 hours, especially if you tell others what they want to hear and leave any bad news you might have to another day. Is that dishonest? Maybe, but it’s not the worst thing you’ll ever do.|01-31-2014|capricorn
62|Too often in the past you have allowed other people to call the shots but now you must do what you want to do, regardless of what the consequences might be. Most likely their will be no comeback at all. Your rivals’ threats are hollow.|02-01-2014|capricorn
63|The most important thing this week is that you know your own mind and don’t let others tell you what you ought to believe. No matter how loud the so-called “experts” may be you must trust what your inner voice tells you – always.|02-03-2014|capricorn
64|Someone whose point of view is very different to your own will say something that you cannot let pass and most likely you will end up having a major argument. But that’s okay. It’s wrong to remain silent. Call it as you see it.|02-04-2014|capricorn
65|You will learn something to your advantage today, but you must keep the information to yourself. The urge to tell others may be strong but if you do they may try to benefit as well — and there is only so much cash to go around! |02-05-2014|capricorn
66|Be careful when dealing with people whose outlook on life is very different to your own. If you adopt the attitude that you are always right and they are always wrong then conflict is inevitable. Maybe you’re both right – or both wrong!|02-06-2014|capricorn
67|If you want something enough you will find a way to get it but it may cost you a great deal of time and energy. What you have to decide is whether the sacrifice is worth it. Think long-term and give up something today for something better tomorrow.|02-07-2014|capricorn
68|You may have something urgent to say, but now that Mercury (planet of communication) is moving retrograde, you will find it difficult to find the right words. Don’t worry: As important as your message is, it won’t hurt to wait.|02-08-2014|capricorn
69|You will find it easier to be assertive on the work front over the next seven days but don’t go too far and give others the impression that you are turning into a dictator. In the long-term persuasion always works better than coercion.|02-10-2014|capricorn
70|You may be tempted to do a task the hard way today, simply because you want to impress people in positions of power, but it isn’t necessary. What matters is that you can get the job done, not how you choose to do it. |02-11-2014|capricorn
71|Something you see or hear on your travels could be just what you’ve been waiting for. Even if it isn’t it will still be a lot of fun and fun is something that has been lacking of late. Don’t doubt yourself in any way. Just be who you are.|02-12-2014|capricorn
72|You may want to be open and sociable but with communications planet Mercury now turning retrograde you would be wise not to give too much away. Anyone who starts asking personal questions is most likely not to be trusted.|02-13-2014|capricorn
73|It seems you would rather go on making mistake after mistake rather than admit you are on the wrong track. Your fixity of purpose is often a great strength but not when you so obviously need to change direction. It’s time to get real.|02-14-2014|capricorn
74|It may seem as if you have been left out of the loop, that everyone is more clued up than you, but it isn’t true, and even if it was it wouldn’t make any difference. You don’t need to be “in the know”, you just need to be you.|02-15-2014|capricorn
75|The Sun leaves the financial area of your chart tomorrow but you still need to take care of your money and possessions. If you let down your guard, even for a moment, someone will try to part you from your hard-earned cash.|02-17-2014|capricorn
76|Get out and about. Visit places that excite you and visit people who inspire you. Social activities of all kinds are under excellent stars, as is travel, so hit the road and don’t look back. Keep moving and the fun will keep on coming.|02-18-2014|capricorn
77|If you make a promise today, you will have to keep that promise come what may, so think carefully before making any kind of commitment. With Mercury, planet of communication, under lots of pressure maybe you should keep your mouth shut. |02-19-2014|capricorn
78|Let people know what is on your mind today. Let them know what you are thinking and why it is important. If you keep your thoughts to yourself you will not only feel isolated but you will miss out on a chance to influence the great debate.|02-20-2014|capricorn
79|Don’t waste your time or your energy on someone who seems determined to get under your skin. You can be a bit obsessive at times and if you let this little feud go on it could develop into something quite dangerous. Just walk away.|02-21-2014|capricorn
80|Your confidence may be at a low right now but you will perk up considerably when you see what the weekend has to offer. Don’t turn down a social invitation because you are not in the mood. It could be more fun than you can handle!|02-22-2014|capricorn
81|The planets are urging you to go out and have a good time. Do you need to be told twice? This is an excellent time for meeting people and swapping ideas about, well, just about everything. The more you chat the more your awareness will grow.|02-23-2014|capricorn
82|Even if you are the kind of Capricorn who too often lets your inhibitions get in the way of having fun you will enjoy yourself immensely over the next few days. Why not look up a friend you have not seen or talked to in a while?|02-24-2014|capricorn
83|You will get a lot out of social activities today, so make the effort to get out into the world. The more you allow yourself to engage with people, both friends and strangers, the more you will realize just how similar we all are.|02-25-2014|capricorn
84|You don’t mind taking chances but with Jupiter in your opposite sign at odds with Uranus, planet of the unexpected today, it might be better to play safe. There is no such thing as a sure thing and you are smart enough to know that.|02-26-2014|capricorn
85|For the past two or three weeks you have found it hard to get your thoughts together, which means progress has been slow, but now your mind will click into gear and you will soon be sailing along. Don’t plan ahead, just act.|02-27-2014|capricorn
86|Don’t reject what you hear just because it sounds outrageous. What seems amazing to you may be an everyday occurrence to other people, so let your mind be open to all possibilities. It doesn’t, of course, mean you have to agree with them.|02-28-2014|capricorn
87|Don’t hide your thoughts or disguise your feelings: let others know what is on your mind and in your heart. The planets urge you to speak up and make yourself heard. Will others like what you have to tell them? Of course they will!|03-01-2014|capricorn
88|You will get the chance to mend a fractured relationship when Jupiter moves in your favor again in midweek. No matter what may have gone on between you and no matter how many bad words may have been said you CAN still make it work.|03-02-2014|capricorn
89|Try not to let your suspicious nature get the better of you over the next few days because there is precious little you have to worry about. Pluto in your sign means others should be more afraid of you than you of them.|03-03-2014|capricorn
90|There is every chance that you will lose your temper with a work colleague over the next 24 hours. But don’t get so angry that you risk bursting a blood vessel. Why put your health at risk over someone else’s stupidity?|03-04-2014|capricorn
91|This should be a highly productive day but there is a danger that in your haste to show what you can do you will take on too many tasks and spread yourself too thin. Focus on the one thing you are really good at – and do it brilliantly.|03-05-2014|capricorn
92|You’ve got this nagging feeling that you could have done more to make a success of a relationship. Maybe you’re right, maybe you could, but that was then and this is now, so stop looking back and look to the future instead.|03-06-2014|capricorn
93|No matter how well you have planned things there are sure to be hold-ups and disruptions today and over the weekend, so promise yourself that you won’t get angry with people who move and think slowly. Stay calm. You’ll get there.|03-07-2014|capricorn
94|You need to get used to the idea that not everyone sees things the same way as you. Maybe it would help if, over the weekend, you make a point of talking with people whose opinions you don’t understand. Get to know them better.|03-08-2014|capricorn
95|You may not understand why certain things had to happen but your sixth sense tells you that was how it was meant to be. With that thought in mind, let others argue about the state of the world. All you have to do is find ways to enjoy it.|03-09-2014|capricorn
96|Stay calm and don’t allow yourself to get carried away with your own success. The current cosmic picture makes most things possible for you but that does not mean you should try to do everything, at least not all at the same time.|03-10-2014|capricorn
97|Many of the restrictions you have been laboring under in recent weeks will seem to get worse over the next few days. A crisis point will be reached around the time of the full moon on the 16th – after which they will all fade quickly away.|03-11-2014|capricorn
98|Keep your options open over the next 24 hours, especially in your dealings with work colleagues and business partners. Because their plans are likely to change suddenly you may have to change too, but if you’re flexible you will still be in the money.|03-12-2014|capricorn
99|You may not understand how and why certain events had to happen but you can see there is no point being negative about it. While others are complaining today you will be making the most of the changes taking place around you.|03-13-2014|capricorn
100|If someone tries to pressure you into doing something you don’t really approve of today then you must turn them down flat. Yes, you may owe them for favors they have done you in the past but conscience comes first, even before friendship.|03-14-2014|capricorn
101|Do you continue with a project that is taking up so much time and energy, or do you end it and move on to something else? Don’t make any final decisions this weekend. You may be too close to the situation to make a rational choice.|03-15-2014|capricorn
102|Don’t take what you hear over the next few days too seriously because a lot of it will be no more than gossip. It could also be the case that someone who has an axe to grind may be trying to turn you against a friend.|03-16-2014|capricorn
103|A social event will be a lot of fun and could lead to a new career opportunity. Knowledge and experience are always important but if it comes down to a tie-break between you and a rival it’s who you know that will count.|03-17-2014|capricorn
104|At some point today you will discover that your money situation is not as bad as you thought it was and that will cheer you up immensely. But it is not an excuse to go on a spree – that’s how you got so worried in the first place.|03-18-2014|capricorn
105|The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow means you can at last get to grips with a family issue that has been causing you plenty of grief. Let loved ones know what you think and how you feel and invite them to be honest with you as well.|03-19-2014|capricorn
106|You don’t need to explain why you are doing certain things, not even to the people you love. Others will respect you more if you are confident about following your dreams and desires. Don’t complain. Don’t explain. Don’t apologize. Just act.|03-20-2014|capricorn
107|Say what you believe to be true and don’t worry too much about the effect it may have on other people. Facts are facts and must not be denied, not even to spare the feelings of those who are not as smart or as stable as you.|03-21-2014|capricorn
108|You may think you don’t need to change, that everything in your life is fine as it is, but is that really true? What happens this weekend will show you that change does not have to be something you need to avoid. It can even be fun.|03-22-2014|capricorn
109|The more others tell you that something cannot be done the more determined you will be to do it. But you must stay within the bounds of what is ethical and legal. If you cut corners your enemies will seize on it to damage your reputation.|03-23-2014|capricorn
110|Creatively and romantically the sky is the limit this week and with travel plans so well starred at the moment you really should be on the move. Don’t let family duties hold you back. You are entitled to some time for yourself.|03-24-2014|capricorn
111|Mars, planet of action and ambition, is moving through the career area of your chart, so chances are you will be even more go-getting than usual. You may face opposition to your plans but you have never been one to avoid a fight.|03-25-2014|capricorn
112|It’s not like you to be so easygoing about people you don’t much like and opinions you think are stupid but you seem to have reached a point where, frankly, you no longer care. Getting uptight about things is not worth the hassle.|03-26-2014|capricorn
113|No matter how busy you may be work wise at the moment you must make an effort to free up some time to spend with your friends and your family. They are the people who really matter. For the moment at least your career comes second.|03-27-2014|capricorn
114|Pluto in your sign endows you with the courage that is needed to get things done and today and over the weekend you will push yourself harder than you have done for a long time. But it’s not just about physical effort – think harder, and deeper, too.|03-28-2014|capricorn
115|No matter how many upsets and upheavals there have been on the home front of late you can and you will resolve them all. This weekend’s new moon will not only enable you to call a truce but will also help you build bridges that last.|03-29-2014|capricorn
116|Be honest about how you feel over the next few days, because if you give others the impression that everything is fine they will most likely continue to do the kind of things that upset you. Its okay to be sensitive, and it’s okay to admit it.|03-30-2014|capricorn
117|Find a nice quiet place where you can switch off from the world around you and get your thoughts together. And remember: if you want to find peace in your life as a whole you first need to find it in your own heart and head.|03-31-2014|capricorn
118|Something you have been working on for quite some time needs to be left alone for a while. According to the planets you have got so involved with it that other areas of your life are being neglected. Time to balance things out again.|04-01-2014|capricorn
119|Avoid all forms of negative thinking. If you let even one little doubt enter your mind it will grow alarmingly quickly and before you know it you will think the world is coming to an end. The fact is you have precisely nothing to worry about.|04-02-2014|capricorn
120|If you believe in yourself and work diligently towards a well defined goal there is no reason why your name should not be up in lights – and your bank balance blessed by a large input of cash. It’s really up to you now.|04-03-2014|capricorn
121|Why is it that some people seem to enjoy making life so complicated? Whatever the reason you don’t have to follow their example, so keep things simple today and don’t go searching for complicated answers to what are such straightforward questions.|04-04-2014|capricorn
122|You want to get out and about and explore but chores and duties are holding you back. So ignore them. Will the world come to a premature end if you don’t get certain tasks finished in a particular time frame? Of course not.|04-05-2014|capricorn
123|Others may be buzzing here, there and everywhere changing anything and everything but you are advised to keep your life just the way it is. Change for change’s sake is rarely a good idea and as a Capricorn you know the value of tradition.|04-06-2014|capricorn
124|Turn on the charm and make sure you get your way. Remember too that the best way to get other people to agree with you is to appeal to them on an emotional level. Facts and figures are important, of course, but it’s feelings that tip the balance.|04-07-2014|capricorn
125|Some interesting opportunities are opening up to you but you need to be aware of the fact that they will bring an increase in responsibilities too. You only have so much time and energy to spare, so choose what you use them for carefully.|04-08-2014|capricorn
126|Steer clear of negative thoughts and feelings because once they have got their hooks in you it will take a lot of work to break free again. Everything will work out for the best in the end – somehow it always does – so why be afraid?|04-09-2014|capricorn
127|You can be a bit sarcastic at times and the planets warn that your caustic way with words could have long-term consequences that damage not only others but you as well. Ask yourself this: will your words hurt or will they heal?|04-10-2014|capricorn
128|Something unexpected will happen today and because you like everything to be in its right place and happening at the right time chances are you will be thrown out of your stride. Good. It’s not healthy to get too set in your ways.|04-11-2014|capricorn
129|Any moves you make this weekend must be the result of serious thought and careful consideration. Weigh up all the pros and cons and only take action when you are sure you will be on the winning side. Failing that, take no action at all.|04-12-2014|capricorn
130|Anyone who thinks you can easily be fooled will quickly learn the error of their ways. Monday’s Mercury-Jupiter link warns there are people out there who will try to cheat you, most likely financially, but you are far too smart for them.|04-13-2014|capricorn
131|Pluto, planet of power, turns retrograde in your sign today, which among other things suggests that your grip on certain situations may not be as strong as you thought. In one particular area it may even pay you to let go completely.|04-14-2014|capricorn
132|This is the sort of day when it is probably best to keep your plans to yourself. You don’t have to be dishonest about what you are up to but it will pay you to be evasive. Others have no right to know about your aims and ambitions.|04-15-2014|capricorn
133|You may have to own up to a transgression of some sort today but the moment you do you will feel a lot better for it. You have been carrying a lot of burdens lately, not least the burden of a guilty conscience. Get past it.|04-16-2014|capricorn
134|It would appear that someone you work with has made a mistake and would like nothing better than to blame you for it. Don’t let that happen! They’re not the only ones who can point fingers. Let them know you can play that game too.|04-17-2014|capricorn
135|You don’t seem much in the mood for serious things at the moment, so get any chores that are expected of you out of the way quickly, then devote yourself to the kind of social activities that bring a smile to your face.|04-18-2014|capricorn
136|The Sun’s move into the most dynamic area of your chart this weekend is sure to bring a smile to your face. More importantly, it will help you believe that the kind of success you have long dreamed about is now within your grasp. And it is.|04-19-2014|capricorn
137|Life seems more exciting all of a sudden and that’s great. It will be greater still if you find out what is worrying a loved one and do what it takes to put their mind at ease. Then you can have even more fun going places together.|04-20-2014|capricorn
138|If you have learnt anything in recent months it must surely be that getting uptight and throwing tantrums rarely, if ever, changes anything for the better. The best way to resolve differences is to turn on the charm – you’ve got plenty of it.|04-21-2014|capricorn
139|You may be entitled to get angry with someone who has let you down but is it worth the effort? Chances are it would be more sensible to forgive and forget, not least because they will then be in your debt, and that could be useful.|04-22-2014|capricorn
140|Yours may not be the most flexible sign of the zodiac but it will pay you to make an effort to adapt today. You have a great deal going for you at the moment but to make the most of it you need to be less set in your ways.|04-23-2014|capricorn
141|You don’t have to come on strong to make your point – on the contrary, others will be more receptive to what you say if you say it calmly and clearly and with no hint of a threat. They want to believe you, so don’t make it difficult for them.|04-24-2014|capricorn
142|You want to go out and have a good time but you also want to express your feelings openly and honestly. Yes, you can do both. This is the perfect day to use those three magic words “I love you”. Say them as if you mean them.|04-25-2014|capricorn
143|You won’t hesitate to put your own interests first this weekend and there is no good reason why you should not. In fact, the next two or three weeks promise to be special, so know what you want and where to get it, then make it your own.|04-26-2014|capricorn
144|This week’s eclipse in the sympathetic sign of Taurus will inspire you to aim higher than ever before. There are no limits to what you can accomplish and there is no doubt you will be praised to the skies. Will that inflate your ego? Of course!|04-27-2014|capricorn
145|You are full of energy thanks to the approaching eclipse and it’s important that you channel it in constructive directions. Don’t waste your time on projects that are not challenging enough or people who don’t share your vision. Always aim high.|04-28-2014|capricorn
146|You can expect some kind of breakthrough over the next 24 hours, the kind you will remember for years to come. Whatever it is you dream of achieving you know it can be done and you know that this is the time to make it happen.|04-29-2014|capricorn
147|Anything of a creative nature will go well for you but it will go even better if you make an effort to bring other people into your plans. Friends and loved loves want to help you but they don’t want to be seen as invading your space.|04-30-2014|capricorn
148|For some strange reason you seem reluctant to take advantage of an opportunity most people would give their right arm for. Yes, of course, it could go wrong but it could also go stunningly right – and unless you try you will never know.|05-01-2014|capricorn
149|Take difficulties in your stride and find ways to get something constructive from them. The Sun in Taurus at this time of year has a hugely positive effect on your outlook on life. Many of life’s setbacks can easily be turned into blessings.|05-02-2014|capricorn
150|Anyone who thinks you have been taking things too easy of late will no doubt be surprised how busy you are over the next few days. Pluto in your sign makes you incredibly ambitious and it’s never too early to start winning.|05-03-2014|capricorn
151|No, you don’t have to do everything now, immediately, right this very moment. Others may be pushing you to get things done but you must not let them rush you. A job worth doing well is a job worth taking time over.|05-04-2014|capricorn
152|It won’t be long before you get the chance to do something out of the ordinary but for the time being you are advised to be patient. If you make your move too soon the results may not be as good as they could have been.|05-05-2014|capricorn
153|You may be eager for success but don’t forget the many responsibilities that go with it. Remember, once you have committed to do something, once you have signed on the line, you won’t be able to back out of the deal.|05-06-2014|capricorn
154|You have chopped and changed so often in recent weeks that you may no longer be sure which way is up, but that’s okay. On the work front at least you will know without a shadow of a doubt what needs to be done next. So do it.|05-07-2014|capricorn
155|Most things seem to be going well for you at the moment, and that’s good, but the planets warn you must not get too content with your lot and drift along without trying. When things are going good you should be aiming for great!|05-08-2014|capricorn
156|Do what you can to bring people together today but if it proves too tough a task just back off and let them fight it out. Do not, under any circumstances, get involved on a personal level yourself. If you choose sides you’ll be the loser.|05-09-2014|capricorn
157|If you are not already moving up in the world you soon will be. Your rise will be quicker, however, if you are honest with yourself about your weaknesses as well as your strengths. You can bet your rivals are aware of them already.|05-10-2014|capricorn
158|You will receive an offer that sounds pretty good over the next few days but you are advised to find out exactly what will be expected of you before you accept. Make sure you read the small print you don’t want any nasty surprises later on.|05-11-2014|capricorn
159|You seem amazingly open at the moment, not in the least bit reserved, which is great – but watch out you don’t let slip information that it might be sensible to keep to yourself. You don’t have to tell everyone about everything.|05-12-2014|capricorn
160|This is one of the best times of the year for you and you really should be making the most of it. It might not be true to say that anything is possible but most things are, so set your sights high and make greatness your goal.|05-13-2014|capricorn
161|You will be rather forthright in your views today and not everyone will like it. Too bad. Most of the time you keep your opinions to yourself but every now and again you go right the other way and shout them from the rooftops.|05-14-2014|capricorn
162|All sorts of opportunities are opening up for you now but they will be a lot more fun if you invite family and friends to join you on your journey. Make sure what you do for yourself you do also for the people care for.|05-15-2014|capricorn
163|You’ve enjoyed an easy ride in recent weeks and you know that at some stage you will have to pay for it. That stage will most likely arrive when the Sun changes signs on the 21st, so make the most of your freedom.|05-16-2014|capricorn
164|Both at home and at work you must stick up for yourself this weekend. Let everyone know that while you might be a nice guy by nature that does not mean you will allow the world to walk all over you. Tread on a few toes yourself.|05-17-2014|capricorn
165|Pay close attention to details over the next few days, because the smallest of things could trip you up. Also, something that has been a habit longer than you care to remember needs to be junked. It’s holding you back, not holding you up.|05-18-2014|capricorn
166|It may seem as if those around you don’t care about your problems but the fact is few if any of them know how much you have been suffering. If you speak up today you will get the help you need. If you stay quiet, you won’t.|05-19-2014|capricorn
167|There is no point arguing with people in positions of power, especially now that Mars, planet of ambition, is resuming its normal direction. You may not agree with what they are doing but you’d be wise not to shout about it. You’ll get your chance later.|05-20-2014|capricorn
168|As the Sun moves into the work and wellbeing area of your chart today you would be wise to slow things down a bit, even if it means cutting back on your goals. Getting things done quickly is not as important as getting them done right.|05-21-2014|capricorn
169|Don’t be afraid to break the rules today. You may be a straight up sort of person but sometimes even a Capricorn has to take a shortcut to get where they most want to be. So long as it does not hurt other people it’s not immoral.|05-22-2014|capricorn
170|Over the next few days you will have to decide what is worth carrying on with and what needs to be junked. Don’t let sentiment play a part in your decision: put your own needs first and don’t let other people influence you in any way.|05-23-2014|capricorn
171|You will find it remarkably easy to make a positive impression on people in positions of power this weekend and if you are smart you will take full advantage of that fact. You may think of them as special but they think you are special too.|05-24-2014|capricorn
172|Attitude is everything over the next few days. If you approach what you have to do with confidence and a genuine belief that you will enjoy it then you’ll have a great time – and get great results too. Your mind creates your reality.|05-25-2014|capricorn
173|If you feel a bit run down as the new week begins that’s a sure sign you have been overdoing it. Even a Capricorn needs their rest, so put your well being first and don’t worry that you might fall behind. In fact you’re still well ahead.|05-26-2014|capricorn
174|You may be a creature of habit but even you can recognize that certain ways of doing things are not working as well as they should. It’s time to push your ego to one side and admit, if only to yourself, that changes are needed.|05-27-2014|capricorn
175|Keep on doing what you are doing and don’t listen to those who say you should be doing something else. The more others try to pick holes in your plans the more certain you can be that you are on the right track. Keep going.|05-28-2014|capricorn
176|Something you previously found difficult will come easier to you today. You may still have to struggle in other areas but the planets will generally give your spirits a lift and help you believe that most, if not quite all, things are possible.|05-29-2014|capricorn
177|If someone in a position of power says or does something that you disagree with today you would be wise not to let it show. According to the planets you are not yet strong enough to confront them directly, so be smart and keep your distance.|05-30-2014|capricorn
178|The Sun’s link to Mars this weekend will boost both your ambitions and your confidence and that’s a winning combination. On the work front, especially, you will gain new and important admirers, though some may see you as a threat.|05-31-2014|capricorn
179|Keep reminding yourself that you are human and that humans are supposed to make mistakes. Sometimes you can be too demanding of yourself and too critical when things go wrong, as at times they inevitably will. Lighten up – it’s life.|06-01-2014|capricorn
180|Are you working more for other people than you are for yourself? According to the planets you are, so get a grip on the situation and let those who are taking advantage of your generous nature know that’s as far as it goes. And mean it.|06-02-2014|capricorn
181|You will be required to take on more tasks and responsibilities over the next few days and though it may seem as if you are being unfairly restricted there is no doubt you will be repaid in full later in the month. Keep smiling.|06-03-2014|capricorn
182|You will have to make sacrifices above and beyond the call of duty today but the effort will be worth it. Not only do you have enough energy and enthusiasm to get things done for yourself but you will gladly help others as well.|06-04-2014|capricorn
183|Current influences highlight the need to be efficient, to get the most from yourself for the least input of time and energy. Pace yourself sensibly and look for ways, even in the smallest of things, to get from A to B quickly and simply.|06-05-2014|capricorn
184|Your views and opinions may be a little out of the ordinary, maybe even outrageous in some people’s eyes, but no way should you change them. According to the planets they are closer to the truth than you realize, so keep searching.|06-06-2014|capricorn
185|The planets warn you may need to make a special effort to keep your temper in check. If you cannot get along with certain people then at least try to stay out of their way. Hopefully they will stay away from you too.|06-07-2014|capricorn
186|You may look fearless to the world at large but you have worries and anxieties like everyone else and some of them will bubble to the surface over the next few days. Don’t be afraid to question your own motivations.|06-08-2014|capricorn
187|It’s good that you want to put the world to rights but don’t pick fights where they are not really necessary. Before getting involved in other people’s affairs you should always ask yourself what the chances are of doing more harm than good.|06-09-2014|capricorn
188|You may find it hard to feel sorry for someone who has clearly brought their difficulties on themselves but if they approach you for help today you won’t turn them away. Beneath that tough exterior beats a heart of gold.|06-10-2014|capricorn
189|If you live in dread of things that might never happen you will almost certainly miss out on something that would have made life a lot more exciting and a lot more rewarding. Don’t try to avoid life – celebrate it in all it’s glory.|06-11-2014|capricorn
190|There is a danger that you will go to extremes today and start believing that nothing bad can possibly happen. That kind of thinking is guaranteed to set off a cosmic chain of events designed to remind you that few things are written in stone.|06-12-2014|capricorn
191|You may not be able to make much sense of what is happening at the moment but don’t worry – you are not the only one who is having a hard time getting a grip on reality. Once the full moon starts to fade all will be revealed.|06-13-2014|capricorn
192|Important people are watching you closely and with Mars inspiring you to be more dynamic on the career front you are sure to make an impression. But will it be the right impression? Whatever else you do, don’t lose your temper.|06-14-2014|capricorn
193|Someone you work with has made a mistake and is looking for someone on whom they can pin the blame. Don’t let it be you. If they start pointing the finger in your direction you must point back and fight back. Don’t be the fall guy.|06-15-2014|capricorn
194|You will have to accept more of a supporting role over the next few days but it’s no big deal. Capricorn is a cardinal sign, which means you like to take the lead, but sometimes it’s better to let others take responsibility.|06-16-2014|capricorn
195|Ignore people who say that certain things cannot or should not be done. If you feel that a course of action is right for you then there is nothing more that needs to be said. Pay attention only to what your inner voice tells you.|06-17-2014|capricorn
196|A Venus-Jupiter link is about as good an influence as you could hope for, especially where your love life is concerned. You will meet some interesting people today and one in particular could become much more than just a friend.|06-18-2014|capricorn
197|If you don’t feel in the mood for working today don’t push yourself. Even if you force yourself to do what is expected of you it’s unlikely you’ll make a good job of it, so wait until you are in a more positive frame of mind.|06-19-2014|capricorn
198|You seem to have resigned yourself to the idea that you will have to take a loss on something that just hasn’t been working out the way you planned. Don’t be too hasty. What happens today and over the weekend will cheer you up no end.|06-20-2014|capricorn
199|The Sun moves into your opposite sign of Cancer today, meaning you are almost at the midpoint between one birthday and the next. Consequently, this is a good time to take stock of how far you have come – and how far you still have to go.|06-21-2014|capricorn
200|It would be nice if others would change their ways to accommodate your needs but it isn’t going to happen. Stop daydreaming and start doing the things that will move your life in the direction you want it to go. It’s all down to you.|06-22-2014|capricorn
201|Try not to make too much of a fuss if someone with whom you live, work or do business makes a mess of what they do today. Not everyone can be as super efficient as you, so make allowances and make sure, if it’s important, you do it yourself next time|06-23-2014|capricorn
202|Decide what it is you need to accomplish, then set about it with energy and self-belief. No matter how many disappointments you have suffered in recent weeks the planets indicate that from here on it will be success all the way.|06-24-2014|capricorn
203|The planets warn if you don’t make a decision soon about a career matter it will be taken out of your hands. Don’t get too hung up on available choices – whatever you go for will work out well for you in the end.|06-25-2014|capricorn
204|Take what happens today as a challenge rather than as a setback. Everything that occurs in your life – including things you tend to think of as “bad” – has a meaning behind it and a lesson to be learned. Fate is rarely unkind.|06-26-2014|capricorn
205|A new moon in your opposite sign of Cancer means that partners and loved ones will be full of themselves over the next 24 hours. Instead of getting angry about it why don’t you join in the fun? You can be too serious you know!|06-27-2014|capricorn
206|You may want to cut yourself off from the world for a while but you know that isn’t possible. There is so much going on that your only realistic option is to get more involved. Problems are there to be solved.|06-28-2014|capricorn
207|You will be asking yourself some important questions this week and the answers will come quicker than you expected. Where your career is concerned you may find it pays to aim a little lower. You don’t have to be top dog every time.|06-29-2014|capricorn
208|You need to get your everyday affairs in order but to do that you will need to be more ruthless than you have been of late. Anything that distracts you from your aims must be cut out of your life altogether. That includes people too.|06-30-2014|capricorn
209|Try not to say things merely to get a reaction because you may get the kind of feedback that does not meet with your approval. Partners and colleagues will be rather touchy over the next 24 hours, so either say nice things or keep quiet.|07-01-2014|capricorn
210|What a friend has to tell you today may not be what you were hoping to hear but the important thing is it’s what you need to hear. Are you smart enough to realize you don’t know all the answers? If so, you’re smarter than most.|07-02-2014|capricorn
211|As Venus, planet of harmony, is moving through the area of your chart that governs your wellbeing it might be wise to take things easy today. That’s easy by Capricorn standards, of course. People will still get exhausted just watching you.|07-03-2014|capricorn
212|There is no point trying to force the pace because the Sun opposing Pluto in your sign won’t let you – and will also remind you where the real power lies. Also, focus on finishing what has already been started. Save new projects for another day.|07-04-2014|capricorn
213|You need to be careful this weekend, especially on the work front where you could damage your long-term prospects if you let your feelings get the better of you. No matter what is said or done you must not rise to the bait.|07-05-2014|capricorn
214|You may not be the sort to run from a fight but the planets warn it might be better to avoid trouble rather than face it head on over the next few days. Pick your battles carefully. In other words, pick the ones you know you can win.|07-06-2014|capricorn
215|Every once in a while you do something that shocks even those who know you well and the planets suggest you will go out of your way to be controversial today. Tomorrow, no doubt, you will be making apologies left, right and center.|07-07-2014|capricorn
216|You like to take your time with new ideas but if you do that today you could miss out on a glorious opportunity. The first idea that comes into your head is the idea you must follow, no matter how silly it might seem to begin with.|07-08-2014|capricorn
217|You don’t need to change direction, no matter what certain people might say. You are where you are meant to be and you are following the path that was designed for you and you alone. Stay on it. You’ll get where you most need to be.|07-09-2014|capricorn
218|Although the approaching full moon is making you anxious everything will come right in the end – it almost always does. The so-called “bad” things that happen in life are often challenges designed to help you grow emotionally, mentally and spiritually.|07-10-2014|capricorn
219|Your energy may take a bit of a dip over the next 24 hours but don’t let it worry you because compared to most people you are still on red hot form. Limit yourself to what is truly important. Nothing matters more than your No.1 aim.|07-11-2014|capricorn
220|Today’s full moon in your sign will make you more emotional than usual and that could cause problems. Be aware – and accept – that not everyone sees things the same way as you, nor is there any logical reason why they should.|07-12-2014|capricorn
221|It’s time to sort out a money matter or business issue that has been causing you sleepless nights. There is no point getting angry or making threats because that will only make matters worse. If you are reasonable others will be reasonable too.|07-13-2014|capricorn
222|Stay cool and look for ways to turn new developments to your advantage. If you can do that this should be an amazingly productive time for you. Listen to other people’s suggestions too, even though they may not always be to your liking.|07-14-2014|capricorn
223|Don’t feel bad if life seems to be rather low key just now. You may be on the down side of the slope at the moment but things are sure to pick up as the week progresses. Be patient and wait for your chance to shine.|07-15-2014|capricorn
224|You can feel your confidence beginning to return and by the end of the week you will have forgotten that you ever doubted yourself. Your ability to make things happen is still there, so identify your goals and work resolutely towards them.|07-16-2014|capricorn
225|The only way you are going to get what you desire is to communicate with those who can help you. Co-operate with them fully and make sure their needs are catered for as well as your own. There’s more than enough good stuff to go around.|07-17-2014|capricorn
226|You are in a romantic mood at the moment and that’s good. The only danger is that you will put the object of your affection on too high a pedestal and feel devastated when, inevitably, they take a tumble. They’re human, just like you.|07-18-2014|capricorn
227|If someone says something you don’t much like you must resist the urge to get angry about it. If you get uptight they will play on your emotions all the more. If you pretend you don’t care they will most likely leave you alone.|07-19-2014|capricorn
228|You don’t have to suffer in silence if you think you have been hard done by. Speak up and let everyone know you deserve a bigger share of the pie. They may not agree with you but at least you will have started a dialogue.|07-20-2014|capricorn
229|Don’t run yourself into the ground doing things for other people. It’s great that you are so enthusiastic but your energy supply is limited and must be saved for those things that mean something to you personally. Be a bit selfish.|07-21-2014|capricorn
230|As of today you will no longer be satisfied with superficial explanations. You want to know what is really going on, both in your personal life and in the world at large. Dig beneath the surface. Look behind the scenes. The truth is out there.|07-22-2014|capricorn
231|You are entitled to your opinion and you are entitled to be heard but if you think everyone is going to agree with you chances are you will be disappointed. The world would be a dull place indeed if we all thought the same way.|07-23-2014|capricorn
232|It’s not often you probe the deepest corners of your mind but over the next 24 hours you will start asking some rather profound questions. The answers that come up are not being discovered for the first time – you knew them already.|07-24-2014|capricorn
233|You must resist the temptation to look at the world as if everything that happens is a disaster or a tragedy. That kind of thinking tends to be self-fulfilling. Focus only on good news today and soon life will look grand again.|07-25-2014|capricorn
234|It would not be wise to take chances with money this weekend but, on the other hand, you should make far-reaching plans. The course of action you decide on now will pay dividends later on but don’t be tempted by risky investments.|07-26-2014|capricorn
235|You will receive good news over the next few days, news that will cheer you up no end. Maybe things are not as bad as you tend to believe. Maybe Lady Luck is smiling on you after all. Maybe you should smile more!|07-27-2014|capricorn
236|What you hear today may not exactly thrill you, but neither is at as bad as some people are trying to make out, so don’t overreact. A negative thought is a powerful thing and can easily become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Always be positive.|07-28-2014|capricorn
237|Something you are working on would benefit from a second opinion this weekend. If you want it to be a success you must listen to advice from those who have been there and done it before you. You can and must learn from their mistakes.|07-29-2014|capricorn
238|Don’t come on too strong today or you could turn people against you and, in doing so, damage both your reputation and your earning power. You may think you can get away with almost anything but it isn’t true. Be assertive but be smart too.|07-30-2014|capricorn
239|It may seem as if others are trying to make life difficult for you but more likely you are making life difficult for yourself. What happens in the world “out there” depends so much on what goes on inside your head. Think about it.|07-31-2014|capricorn
240|You have a bit of an obsession with perfection but you need to remember that not everyone shares it. It’s good to feel that you are in control but if you take it too far today you might tempt certain people to be obstructive.|08-01-2014|capricorn
241|There is a lot of gossip going around and quite a bit of it seems to be about you. This is one of those times when you should close your ears to what others are saying and do only what you want to do. Nothing else matters.|08-02-2014|capricorn
242|You will find it easy to come and go as you please this week but not everyone will be pleased with your new found sense of freedom. But so what? Do what you want to do and don’t let fear of disapproval hold you back.|08-03-2014|capricorn
243|As mind planet Mercury makes a less than positive link with Neptune, planet of deception, today you could be right to suspect that the deal you’ve been offered is a dud. If there is the slightest doubt in your mind you must turn it down.|08-04-2014|capricorn
244|You are more likely to find answers to your problems if you get creative and look in areas you tend to neglect. You also need to get some input from loved ones and relatives. You don’t have to do it all on your own.|08-05-2014|capricorn
245|You seem to have got it into your head that the best way to solve a problem is to throw money at it. All you will succeed in doing is wasting even more of your precious resources, so think again. There’s plenty you can do for free.|08-06-2014|capricorn
246|There is so much going on in the world at the moment that you may be having trouble making sense of it all but if you keep your eyes and ears open today you will see or hear something that gives you the guidance you seek. Stay sharp.|08-07-2014|capricorn
247|Like everyone else you have fears that can hold you back from fulfilling your potential, but today’s influences will help you confront them and overcome them. There is always a rational explanation for things that go bump in the night.|08-08-2014|capricorn
248|Usually you are careful what you say but over the next 48 hours you will go right the other way and say exactly what you think and feel. You won’t lose any friends though – in fact others will find your frankness refreshing.|08-09-2014|capricorn
249|A full moon in the money area of your chart means you won’t see eye-to-eye with someone over a business or financial matter. Ultimately though it’s no big deal, so give it time and the situation should resolve itself to your benefit.|08-10-2014|capricorn
250|You may not care all that much what is going on in the wider world but at some stage today you will have to wake up to the fact that outside events have a big impact on you. Try to be a bit more outgoing this week.|08-11-2014|capricorn
251|The current cosmic picture will reinforce your determination to transform your existence but it won’t be until the Sun moves in your favor on the 23rd that you can really get started. In the meantime, be patient. Your time will come.|08-12-2014|capricorn
252|You will clash with someone over money today. Your first instinct will be to fight to get back what is yours but after a while you may come to the conclusion that it’s not worth the effort. If it’s gone, just make some more.|08-13-2014|capricorn
253|You will be asked to do a favor today for someone you don’t like very much but if you are smart you will do it with a smile. The fact is they have a lot of power and you could make yourself a useful ally.|08-14-2014|capricorn
254|Avoid get-rich-quick schemes this weekend because most likely they will cost you a fortune. The planets warn if you take silly risks you will pay for it in a big way, maybe not straight away but certainly before the end of the month.|08-16-2014|capricorn
255|By all means speak your mind but try not to say things that could be taken the wrong way. You may not mean to be rude but sometimes you can be rather blunt in your assessment of what is right and what is wrong.|08-17-2014|capricorn
256|Friendships and finances are well starred today, so arrange a trip of some kind – maybe a shopping expedition – with your best friend. You won’t have to spend a fortune to make yourself feel good, but you probably will!|08-18-2014|capricorn
257|Someone will rub you in the wrong way today and you may find it hard to control your tempter. Keeping telling yourself they are not worth the effort and keep doing what you are doing only more so. That will really annoy them!|08-19-2014|capricorn
258|You appear to have pushed yourself a bit too hard, physically and mentally, of late and now you are beginning to feel the effects. If that’s the case then you must give yourself a break. Never mind about your work – it can wait.|08-20-2014|capricorn
259|There are some things that need to be said and Pluto in your sign, linked to communications planet Mercury, will help you find just the right words. Don’t concern yourself with other people’s feelings, concern yourself only with the truth.|08-21-2014|capricorn
260|Something will happen over the next two or three days that forces you to the front of the stage where everyone can see you. You may not want to be a star but the planets, it seems, are making it happen. Why not enjoy it?|08-22-2014|capricorn
261|You have been under a lot of pressure of late but as from today the pressure will ease and very soon you will be back to your best. Whatever problems you have been struggling with don’t give them another thought – they’re simply not worth it.|08-23-2014|capricorn
262|You may be tempted to bend the rules to get what you desire but there is really no need. Everything is going well for you and will go even better when the moon is new tomorrow. The universe is very much on your side at the moment.|08-24-2014|capricorn
263|Do you have the courage to take a different course between now and the end of the year? According to the planets there will be rewards aplenty if you do but your conservative nature could hold you back. Go on, you knowyou want to!|08-26-2014|capricorn
264|You want to do something special today, something that marks you out as a cut above the rest. Make sure, however, that it is something constructive, something that benefits others as well as yourself. It’s okay to be famous, but not infamous.|08-27-2014|capricorn
265|The best way to boost your confidence is to tackle tasks that require total concentration. The less time you have to worry about your problems the more likely it is they will resolve themselves. Very soon you’ll be back to your best.|08-28-2014|capricorn
266|The Sun in Virgo will make it easy to excel creatively, and maybe have a good time romantically as well, so be on the lookout for new opportunities. Something as simple as a smile could set you on an exciting new journey.|08-29-2014|capricorn
267|You may think you know how to put the world to rights but you also need to be aware that you cannot force other people to follow your lead. Make it your aim this weekend to be a good example – then you’ll make a difference.|08-30-2014|capricorn
268|There will always be those who try to talk you down but you must not let their negative words affect what you do. Nothing and no one can stop you from realizing your goals, so ignore the critics and be brilliant in every way.|08-31-2014|capricorn
269|You seem to be under quite a bit of pressure on the work front at the moment but over the next few days that pressure will ease. If nothing else you will see where it is coming from and take steps to calm things down a bit.|09-01-2014|capricorn
270|If a friend or family member is in trouble today you will ride to their rescue no questions asked. However, while you can be generous with your time and sympathy you must be careful with your money. Don’t give it all away.|09-02-2014|capricorn
271|Actions speak louder than words and with Pluto in your sign activated by the Sun you will be all action from the moment you awake to the moment your head hits the pillow tonight. Nothing is beyond you. You’ll make the impossible look easy.|09-03-2014|capricorn
272|No matter how tough the challenges that come your way from now until the end of the year you will handle them all with ease – that’s the message from the stars. Take each day as it comes and accept that it’s already perfect in every way.|09-04-2014|capricorn
273|Travel is very much on your mind at the moment and it’s quite likely you will be going somewhere distant or out of the ordinary. Contacts with foreigners are especially helpful at this time – you could even end up working abroad.|09-05-2014|capricorn
274|You may feel confident, even a bit cocky, at the moment but don’t take too much for granted. The planets warn that a minor setback could easily grow into something big, so stay alert and be the first to act if a crisis kicks-off.|09-06-2014|capricorn
275|There are so many changes taking place in your life and most of them are good, so don’t try to resist them. There are times when you can’t put a foot wrong even if you try and this, it seems, is one of them.|09-07-2014|capricorn
276|Try not to be so intense over the next 24 hours. The planets urge you to take your foot off the gas and cruise for a while. You should know by now you get just as much done with a smile on your face as with a scowl.|09-08-2014|capricorn
277|You are of the opinion that standards have slipped and you intend doing something about it. Before trying to change others though maybe you should take a look at yourself. How can you improve your own performance and be a better example?|09-09-2014|capricorn
278|You want to get as much done as is physically possible but the planets warn you could easily over-extend yourself or, worse, exhaust yourself well before you have reached your target. What’s the rush? The work will still be there tomorrow.|09-10-2014|capricorn
279|Join forces with people who share your concerns, then decide what you can do to make the world a better place. You still need to realize though that lasting change takes time and commitment. Few worthwhile things can be gained overnight.|09-11-2014|capricorn
280|There comes a time when the old must give way to the new and according to the planets you are approaching that time now. Don’t worry. Changes are good for you. Changes will benefit you. Changes are just what you need.|09-12-2014|capricorn
281|For some strange reason you fear the worst but on this occasion fear can be a positive thing in that it will lead you to reappraise your long-term aims. Are you moving in the right direction? Chances are you are not, so get ready to make major changes.|09-13-2014|capricorn
282|By all means look back and work out why certain things went wrong but once you have done so you should forget about them once and for all. Each day is different and each day brings new possibilities, so live for today, and in the moment.|09-14-2014|capricorn
283|Why are you worrying for no good reason? The planets suggest that nothing will happen without your agreement and your say-so, so lighten up and try not to be so defensive about life. If it’s not fun then you’re not doing it right.|09-15-2014|capricorn
284|Jupiter in the wealth area of your chart puts you in a strong position where anything of a financial nature is concerned. If a deal of some sort has to be made you should be the one calling the shots – and taking the lion’s share of the profits.|09-16-2014|capricorn
285|Open your eyes to new possibilities – then take advantage of them. Too often in the past you have been content to let life come to you, but now you must push yourself forward at every opportunity. Success comes to those who dare.|09-17-2014|capricorn
286|Don’t waste time on petty arguments when there are so many important matters that require your attention. Not everyone you meet over the next 24 hours will see things from your point of view but that’s okay. There’s room enough for every opinion.|09-18-2014|capricorn
287|You may be having a great deal of fun but have you considered the consequences which could arise from some of your more impulsive actions? Take time out today to think about what you are doing and why. Tone down your act a bit.|09-19-2014|capricorn
288|Don’t waste your time trying to get other people to think and act like you – it’s not going to happen. You demand the right to be different so you should allow them to be different too – variety is what makes the world such an interesting place.|09-20-2014|capricorn
289|Nothing can be allowed to restrict your movements or stop you from exploring the world around you. Look for meaning in everything you see, hear and do over the next two or three days. You may find more than you expected. |09-21-2014|capricorn
290|What happens over the next few days will have a big impact on your career and your professional reputation. For that reason alone you must do the best work you possibly can and make sure the powers that be can see how talented you are.|09-22-2014|capricorn
291|Some of the people you meet today will want to hear what you think about what’s going on in the world – so tell them. They may be surprised how outspoken you are but nothing gets changed by silence – and they did ask after all!|09-23-2014|capricorn
292|Today’s new moon will be good for your social standing generally and for career matters especially. However, when dealing with employers and other important people you must be honest about your experience and qualifications. Don’t make things up.|09-24-2014|capricorn
293|Partnership problems of one sort or another may be causing you concern but there is no reason to fear the worst. Certain relationships have fallen into a rut and need to be revitalized. What is painful in the short-term will be useful in the long-term.|09-25-2014|capricorn
294|You have been keeping to yourself a lot in recent days and friends and family members are beginning to wonder why. Put their minds at rest by telling them your plans. Just because you’ve been quiet does not mean you’ve been doing nothing.|09-26-2014|capricorn
295|Be wary of people who ask a lot of questions over the next 48 hours. According to the planets they think you know things that could benefit them, and maybe you do, but why should you give it away for free? Information is power. |09-27-2014|capricorn
296|Someone you distrust will greet you in an excessively friendly way during the early part of the week but you won’t be fooled for a moment. You know they are after something and whatever it is you have no intention of giving it to them.|09-28-2014|capricorn
297|Exciting things are happening in your life and most likely you will be making serious gains between now and the end of the week. Career opportunities will come knocking but, as always, it is up to you whether you make good use of them.|09-29-2014|capricorn
298|You are in a serious mood at the moment and may even be searching for the meaning of life. Chances are you won’t have to look far: something that takes place right in front if you will answer all those deep question you have been asking.|09-30-2014|capricorn
299|What you need to remember today is that no matter how well you do in life and no matter how high up the ladder you climb there will always someone bigger and badder than you. In other words: know when you’ve met your match.|10-01-2014|capricorn
300|Even the most ambitious of Capricorns will be at peace with the world today. No matter how much you are provoked you cannot be bothered to react. Tomorrow, though, will be a different story. Some people may regret their choice of words.|10-02-2014|capricorn
301|Your feelings about a career matter are spot on, so listen to your instincts and act on what they tell you. You may be swimming against the tide of opinion at the moment but later on everyone will come round to your way of thinking.|10-03-2014|capricorn
302|You will learn a painful lesson this weekend but fortunately the pain will belong to someone else! What they are going through could so easily happen to you, so work out what they did wrong and promise yourself that you won’t make the same mistake.|10-04-2014|capricorn
303|You can sense that something major is about to happen but you don’t know what it is. Because of this you may be somewhat apprehensive over the next few days but come the end of the week you’ll have found the answers you seek.|10-05-2014|capricorn
304|If you are happy with your social standing that’s great. If not, start thinking about how you would like to change the way you are seen by the world. The approaching eclipse will turn so many things upside down – and for you that’s an opportunity.|10-06-2014|capricorn
305|If you acknowledge your weaknesses now you will be operating from a position of strength later in the week. There is nothing wrong in admitting you are inadequate in certain areas – it means you know where improvements need to be made.|10-07-2014|capricorn
306|Today’s lunar eclipse in the career area of your chart is a powerful omen and if you are anywhere near as ambitious as people think you are you will go all out to start moving up in the world. First though you need to discard your own self-doubts.|10-08-2014|capricorn
307|Communication won’t be easy over the next 24 hours, and when you do seem to get a straight answer from someone you may not be able to trust it. Keep what you want to say for another day – if it’s that important it will wait.|10-09-2014|capricorn
308|Today’s Sun-Jupiter link means you may find it hard to show restraint when dealing with matters of a financial or business nature, but that’s okay. Usually you are totally in control of yourself, so by all means go to the other extreme – just this once.|10-10-2014|capricorn
309|Someone may deserve to be criticized for something they said or did but if you are smart you will resist the urge to get angry and let them know you don’t hold a grudge. They will feel indebted to you and that’s an IOU worth having.|10-11-2014|capricorn
310|If you want to know what is going on over the next few days, both at work and in your social group, you must be more open about your own thoughts and feelings. Others will open up to you if you open up to them first.|10-12-2014|capricorn
311|You may be a small fish in a big pond but your reputation for integrity and excellence are such that even the big fish respect you. Someone in a position of power will come to you for assistance today. You’re more important than you realize.|10-13-2014|capricorn
312|While it may be true that much of what you do in life depends at least in part on other people, there are still many things over which you have total control. One of them is the way you choose to react to events. Be positive and smile often.|10-14-2014|capricorn
313|All work and no play is rarely a good idea and if you go down that route now you may look back later and wish you had been a bit more relaxed about life. Find ways to get others to do things for you and give yourself a break.|10-15-2014|capricorn
314|It would appear that someone, somewhere has been telling lies about you or in some other way putting you down. Find out who it is and who they have talked to and make sure you put the record straight before important people start to believe them.|10-16-2014|capricorn
315|A partnership or relationship issue can easily be resolved today, IF you are prepared to sit down and listen to the other person’s grievances. What you need to realize is that it’s not all about you – they have their dreams and worries as well.|10-17-2014|capricorn
316|If you want something badly enough you can get it with not too much effort but with the Sun and Venus both moving in your favor on Thursday you won’t have to make any effort at all later in the week. Others will do it all for you.|10-19-2014|capricorn
317|The news you receive today may not be entirely to your liking but you will still have plenty of time to adjust. Patience is not only a virtue but a necessity if you are to make significant progress over the next few weeks.|10-20-2014|capricorn
318|You have to make a decision that affects not only your own life but the lives of friends and family and loved ones as well. Think carefully before making your move – then make it decisively knowing that the universe is behind you all the way.|10-21-2014|capricorn
319|Let your imagination roam far and wide over the next two or three days. An idea that pops into your head out of nowhere may seem outrageous but if you think about it a bit you will realize there is no reason why it cannot be your reality.|10-22-2014|capricorn
320|The Sun in Scorpio over the next few weeks will present you with numerous opportunities to showcase your talent and creativity. Don’t copy what others have done before, be original and come up with something new and inspiring.|10-23-2014|capricorn
321|Have you recently taken a decisive step, one that could have a huge effect on the working pattern of your life? If so you are advised to stop and think about it some more. There is still time to change your mind. Nothing is written in stone yet.|10-24-2014|capricorn
322|Mars, planet of energy and ambition, moves into your sign this weekend, where it remains until early December. That means you have just over a month to really push yourself in pursuit of your dreams. Don’t just plan your next move – make it.|10-25-2014|capricorn
323|No matter how far-fetched an idea may seem it will nag at you until you do something about it. Now that mind planet Mercury is moving in your favor again you will find it easy to see what is and is not possible. So think – then act.|10-26-2014|capricorn
324|Nothing and no one can beat or defeat you if you remain focused on your number one objective. Those who oppose you will place all kinds of obstacles in your path over the next few days but you will smash through them all with ease.|10-27-2014|capricorn
325|You must deliver on a promise you made a while ago, even if it means you have to change your plans or miss out on a social event you were looking forward to. Your reputation could nosedive if you fail to deliver.|10-28-2014|capricorn
326|Others will rush this way and that way today trying to get on top of things but you will take it all in your stride. Just make sure you don’t get so laidback about life in general that you neglect certain responsibilities.|10-29-2014|capricorn
327|You may know what is wrong with a certain situation but you are not yet in a position to put it right. In fact, the planets warn quite strongly you should leave well alone. The cosmic picture will change dramatically over the next few days.|10-30-2014|capricorn
328|Take it easy this weekend. It’s okay to let slide what others say should be done immediately. In fact, a short break now will refresh your senses and put you in the right frame of mind to tackle major issues early next week.|11-01-2014|capricorn
329|Try not to get hot under the collar if you discover that a friend has been using your name to get things done. Maybe you should be flattered. The fact that others take notice when your name is mentioned shows hoe well thought of you are.|11-02-2014|capricorn
330|Don’t allow others to talk you into doing something that will tie you down for weeks or even months at a time. You have your own interests and your own goals to pursue and you must put them first, today and every day from now on. |11-03-2014|capricorn
331|How hungry are you for success? If you are typical of your birth sign you are very hungry indeed and what you achieve between now and the end of the year will be little short of extraordinary. Show the world what you are capable of.|11-04-2014|capricorn
332|Resist the urge to make any kind of snap decision today. The Sun at odds with Uranus means you should proceed with caution, both in your private life and in your work. You don’t need upheaval, you need calm. |11-05-2014|capricorn
333|If you try to accommodate each and every viewpoint or opinion over the next 24 hours you are likely to alienate everyone. First impressions are the most reliable, so go with your instincts and back those whose outlook you feel an affinity for.|11-06-2014|capricorn
334|If you want to impress a loved one today you should try something original, exciting and totally unexpected. Your relationship may have fallen into a bit of a rut of late but your feelings for each other are still there, and still worth fighting for.|11-07-2014|capricorn
335|Believe it or not this is one of the best times of the year for you. The only danger is you could spoil it by negative thinking that comes not from your own mind but from the influence of people around you. Think only positive thoughts today. |11-08-2014|capricorn
336|Several surprises lie in store for you over the next few days. Don’t pretend to be shocked if a friend or family member acts in ways you consider to be outrageous – you should know from past experience that they like to provoke reaction.|11-09-2014|capricorn
337|You may feel that you can take on the world and win, and maybe you can, but why make a war of life when you don’t have to? Today’s Mars-Pluto union in your sign endows your personality with power. Just ask for what you want – you’ll get it.|11-10-2014|capricorn
338|There will be good news today, the kind that has been lacking in recent weeks. You may not be able to act on what you learn straight away but at least you know there is something inspiring to look forward to in the near future. |11-11-2014|capricorn
339|Whatever else you do today don’t lose your temper. Even if you have a right to be annoyed you must keep your feelings to yourself. You will be able to express your views in a more positive fashion on Friday and over the weekend.|11-12-2014|capricorn
340|You have a tendency to work harder than most other people but with the Sun at odds with Jupiter today you could go too far and exhaust yourself. Even a Capricorn needs to take it easy once in a while, so schedule some down time – and enjoy it.|11-14-2014|capricorn
341|You are so close to fulfilling an ambition that you may be a bit fearful that something will go wrong at the very last moment. Don’t worry, it won’t. Even if you encounter an obstacle this weekend your momentum will carry you through.|11-15-2014|capricorn
342|Take advantage of an opportunity that has been around for ages without anyone making the most of it. Tuesday’s link between the Sun and your ruling planet Saturn could bring you fame and fortune but you’ve got to act quickly.|11-16-2014|capricorn
343|You may find it hard to cut back on your social life but you know you have to if you are to make the most of a business opportunity. Friends may be disappointed that you can’t come out to play but there will be other times.|11-18-2014|capricorn
344|You may think if you take a risk it will pay off but can you be certain? Unless you are 100 per cent sure of the outcome you should play safe, at least for the next few days. Saturday’s new moon will turn the tide in your favor. |11-19-2014|capricorn
345|What you do today is maybe not so important, but how you do it certainly is. Throw yourself into a task or a project or a relationship 100 per cent – give it everything you’ve got. Your passion will do your reputation no harm at all.|11-20-2014|capricorn
346|What takes place today and over the weekend will reassure you that things are not as bad as they seem and some of the more serious problems that have plagued you in recent weeks will no longer worry you at all. Time to toughen up.|11-21-2014|capricorn
347|If your instincts tell you a different story to the one that everyone else says is true then trust your inner voice. In the age of mass communication there are times when mass illusion rules and this appears to be one of them. Don’t be fooled. |11-22-2014|capricorn
348|Capricorns can be remarkably sensitive at times but they can also be remarkably strong and over the next seven days your inner strength will be needed on a number of occasions. Others will need to rely on you and you won’t let them down.|11-23-2014|capricorn
349|Don’t worry too much about the purpose of what you are doing – if it makes you happy that is purpose enough. Life may be a serious business but that does not mean you can’t have fun once in a while – like right now. |11-24-2014|capricorn
350|There is a pattern to recent events and if you look carefully you will see what it is. Forces outside your control have been guiding you in a new direction but that is no bad thing. If you go with the flow you will enjoy the ride.|11-25-2014|capricorn
351|The more passionately someone tries to convince you of their honesty the more likely it is they want something from you. There may be a sucker born every minute but you don’t have to be one of them. Keep your money in your pocket. |11-26-2014|capricorn
352|If you have been feeling a bit left out of things lately, don’t worry – what happens today, tomorrow and over the weekend will clue you in to what’s going on and maybe even give you a starring role. You’re never out of the limelight for long!|11-27-2014|capricorn
353|A parting of the ways may be necessary but it does not have to be painful. The simple fact is you have moved on and so have they, but in different directions. That’s okay. Life is a learning experience and you have learned plenty from each other.|11-28-2014|capricorn
354|Strive to be positive this weekend, even if the challenges that face you are daunting. The fact is you have been in this kind of situation many times before and come through unscathed and there is no reason why this time should be different. |11-29-2014|capricorn
355|You may look happy and confident but deep down you are worried about a financial matter. The good news is that when Mars moves into the money area of your chart in midweek you will find the motivation to sort it out once and for all.|11-30-2014|capricorn
356|Something you see or hear over the next 24 hours will inspire you to do more with your life. In a nutshell: if someone who does not possess your talents and advantages can be such a huge success then so can you. |12-01-2014|capricorn
357|The task you have set yourself may be tough but you will find ways to make a success of it. Nothing and no one can beat you so long as you remember that challenge and opportunity are two sides of the same coin. |12-02-2014|capricorn
358|Attitude is everything today and if you approach a troublesome situation in a negative frame of mind you will probably find yourself on the losing side. A positive attitude won’t solve all your problems, of course, but it will certainly help.|12-03-2014|capricorn
359|You are in one of your rare extravagant moods and are determined to indulge yourself, no matter what the cost may be. A few days from now you may regret spending so much on so little, but for now you really don’t care. |12-04-2014|capricorn
360|Try not to focus on details today because if you do you could miss the bigger picture. There is a lot going on behind the scenes at the moment and you will need to look both far and deep to stay one step ahead of your rivals. |12-05-2014|capricorn
361|Try not to let your attention wander. Routine matters may be easy to ignore but they will be difficult to put right if you let things slide. There are no shortcuts to success – only consistent effort will earn you the recognition you crave.|12-06-2014|capricorn
362|Don’t be too critical of someone today because later in the week you will need their assistance and they are unlikely to give it if they think you have been too hard on them. There must be something about them you can praise.|12-08-2014|capricorn
363|You need to put your financial house in order, Yes, you will have to make cutbacks, and maybe even sacrifice something you think of as essential to your wellbeing, but in the long-term it will be worth it. On this occasion, less means more. |12-09-2014|capricorn
364|The entry of love planet Venus into your sign today means you can expect good news concerning a long-term relationship. No matter what difficulties you may be going through now they will ease over the next few days, so lighten up. |12-10-2014|capricorn
365|The most important thing now is that you get your financial house in order and cut back on activities that waste both your time and your money. You know what they are and you know what needs to be done, so get cracking!|12-11-2014|capricorn
366|You may be conservative by nature but that does not mean you cannot change your ways and if you feel that a change is necessary you must make it immediately. You don’t change often but when you do you go all the way.|12-12-2014|capricorn
367|You are worrying too much – again. The trouble with worrying, of course, is that it tends to create negative vibrations, which in turn make it more likely that what you fear the most will come about. Strive to be positive.|12-13-2014|capricorn
368|You may not feel entirely confident in taking on a task you have not been trained for but don’t let that stop you. Act as if you know what you are doing and you will be surprised to discover that it’s really quite easy.|12-14-2014|capricorn
369|Try not to come on too strong today because you could push away people who should be your friends and allies. Authority figures will be more impressed if you balance your drive and determination with a large dose of self awareness.|12-15-2014|capricorn
370|As Mercury moves into your birth sign today you are advised to put a name to your dreams. If there is something you desire now is as good a time as any to be open about it. Your lucky stars could make it happen. |12-17-2014|capricorn
371|The new moon on the 22nd – a day after the Sun moves into your birth sign – will do wonders for your courage and confidence. Between now and then though you are advised to keep a low profile. Save your energy for when it is most needed. |12-18-2014|capricorn
372|You may think that certain people have got it in for you but more likely it’s your imagination playing tricks on you. According to the planets you have nothing at all to fear – and everything in the world to look forward to.|12-19-2014|capricorn
373|The old solar year is almost over and, more importantly, a new one is about to begin. The Sun’s entry into your sign tomorrow won’t solve all your problems at once but it will put them in perspective. They’re not really problems at all. |12-20-2014|capricorn
374|Tomorrow’s new moon in your sign makes this the perfect time to make resolutions for the coming year. Don’t wait for new year’s day like everyone else – decide what it is you want most out of life then promise yourself that you will get it.|12-21-2014|capricorn
375|You can expect some wonderful things to happen this week. Today’s new moon in your sign makes this one of the very best times of the year, especially for creative endeavors and affairs of the heart. Tackle life head on – and love every moment!|12-22-2014|capricorn
376|The tougher the task the more you like it but with your ruler Saturn now moving into the most sensitive area of your chart those tasks won’t always be physical in nature. Get your head together and everything else will fall into place.|12-23-2014|capricorn
377|For best results you should try to be on the move today. If you stay in the same place you could miss out on something special, something that could turn an average day into a wonderful day. Get moving and see where fate takes you. |12-24-2014|capricorn
378|Time spent helping others will not be time wasted – in fact you will benefit too in a number of ways. Someone in your family or social circle desperately needs assistance but is too proud to ask. Luckily you’re the sort who likes to help out. |12-25-2014|capricorn
379|You really should be doing more with your talents. You have what it takes to make a significant mark on the world, so stop hiding in the shadows and step into the light. Do something out of the ordinary and get people talking. |12-26-2014|capricorn
380|The year may be drawing to a close but that does not mean that you should be winding down. On the contrary, there is still so much for you to do. Push yourself even harder this weekend. Create something that is made to last.|12-27-2014|capricorn
381|This is always a special time of year for you but with so much positive cosmic activity as you head into the new year the next few days could be stupendous. Don’t limit your dreams in any way. Believe in them and make them come true.|12-28-2014|capricorn
382|Although the Sun is moving through your birth sign something tells you this is not a good day to take chances, not least because you find it hard to separate fact from fiction. Give it a few days and you can take all the chances you want.|12-29-2014|capricorn
383|You can sense that something extraordinary is about to happen and you are right, it is. It will be more extraordinary still if you throw off your Capricorn caution and push yourself above and beyond your accepted limits. In reality you have no limits.|12-30-2014|capricorn
384|No one is out to get you, so stop looking over your shoulder at every turn. The state of mind you begin the new year in is the state of mind that will stay with you throughout 2015, so be positive. It’s really all good. |12-31-2014|capricorn
385|Take things easy today because come the weekend the pace of life is going to pick up considerably. Give both your mind and body a rest after the exertions of the past few weeks. Your emotions could do with a cooling off period too. |01-01-2015|capricorn
386|The words you use are always important but they have added power at the moment, so think about what it is you most want to accomplish then say what needs to be said to move you closer to that goal. Be loud and proud.|01-02-2015|capricorn
387|You will learn something important from someone you meet socially over the next 48 hours. They may love themselves a little too much for your liking but if you play them along you will learn something to your long-term advantage. |01-03-2015|capricorn
388|A full moon in your opposite sign means you need to deal with a relationship issue that isn’t going to go away on its own. Be honest about what it is you expect of the other person – and demand they be honest with you too. |01-04-2015|capricorn
389|You may be in a positive mood at the moment but not everyone is so fortunate and one particular person desperately needs cheering up. Whatever it is that is wrong help them see it is of no real consequence. You’ll soon have them smiling again. |01-06-2015|capricorn
390|You may worry that you have fallen behind in your schedule but the planets indicate there is plenty of time to catch up. Both in your personal life and at work make this a day of thinking and planning rather than doing. |01-07-2015|capricorn
391|For some strange reason you appear to believe that everyone thinks and feels the same as you but what occurs over the next day or two will put you right. It really doesn’t matter if others disagree with you – you can still be friends.|01-08-2015|capricorn
392|Someone in a position of authority is not convinced that you have what it takes to do a certain task, but you will delight in proving them wrong. Have faith in yourself and give 100 per cent. Come tomorrow they will be your biggest fan. |01-09-2015|capricorn
393|You are in a generous mood at the moment, the kind of mood where you would do almost anything for almost anyone. Notice the word “almost” though. It seems there is still one person you can’t bring yourself to be nice to.|01-10-2015|capricorn
394|You will have all sorts of great ideas this week. Not only that but you will actively look for ways to turn those ideas into realities. Hopefully no one will be foolish enough to try to stop you. If they do it could get messy.|01-11-2015|capricorn
395|You will meet some interesting people over the next few days and that’s good because your focus has been too narrow of late. Chances are you will learn something to your advantage too, so keep your eyes and ears open.|01-12-2015|capricorn
396|Partnerships and relationships are under good stars today but you will only feel the benefit if you make an effort to think – and feel – outside your usual range. It’s not about us versus them, it’s about us and them together. |01-13-2015|capricorn
397|What you most need to realize now is that it is not your job to please someone else – it is their job to please you. Partners and loved ones know exactly what it is you desire – all you have to do is let them give it to you. |01-14-2015|capricorn
398|Travel and social activities are well starred at the moment but watch out you don’t stray too far in the wrong direction. It’s one thing to be adventurous but quite another to be foolhardy, so make sure you always know where you are going.|01-15-2015|capricorn
399|If you gamble on something and win today you would be wise not to go any further. The planets warn that once you are ahead the only way you will stay ahead is by calling it a day and playing safe again.|01-16-2015|capricorn
400|This is an extremely important time for you, not least because the Sun leaves your sign in just three days time. Something you started a few weeks ago must be finished now. If you let it drag on it may never get done. |01-17-2015|capricorn
401|You have so many good ideas rattling around inside your head but now you need to get serious and decide which of them you are going to develop. Money is not the most important indicator, but it’s a good guide to start with.|01-18-2015|capricorn
402|Don’t change things for the sake of it today because almost certainly you will have to change them back again when mind planet Mercury turns retrograde on Wednesday. Be happy with the status quo, at least for the time being. |01-19-2015|capricorn
403|Your head is full of good ideas and some of them may even be great but now you need to get your act together and decide which should be followed up and which should be forgotten. First question: what is likely to make you most money? |01-20-2015|capricorn
404|Don’t take anything at face value over the next 24 hours. As mind planet Mercury begins one of its retrograde phases the more others try to convince you that something is clearly right the more likely it is to be wrong. |01-21-2015|capricorn
405|No one expects you to be perfect, so why do you expect it of yourself? If you have made some kind of mistake then hold your hand up and admit it. In the greater scheme of things it’s really no big deal.|01-22-2015|capricorn
406|No the ends do not justify the means and you need to remember that fact. The more someone tries to convince you that you can do something wrong because it will lead to something right the further the distance you need to put between you.|01-23-2015|capricorn
407|If a friend tries to play on your feelings this weekend that’s a sure sign they want something from you. You may, of course, be happy to give it to them but insist they come clean about their motivations first. |01-24-2015|capricorn
408|You may be worried that you have spent too much in recent weeks but don’t go to extremes and deny yourself. It’s one thing to buy something just because it makes you happy but quite another because you really do need it. |01-25-2015|capricorn
409|Once again you are worrying about something that is not worth the hassle. If something about your cash flow situation is bothering you chances are it is mainly, if not entirely, in your mind. So don’t think, just act instinctively.|01-26-2015|capricorn
410|The whole world could be against you now and it would not worry you in the slightest – your confidence is unshakable. Just be careful you don’t overdo it and create rivals where none need exist. Confidence is one thing, arrogance quite another.|01-27-2015|capricorn
411|You may be tempted to cut corners and do less than your best on a task of some kind today but is that such a good idea? Chances are it will lead to mistakes and those mistakes will cost a lot to correct. Get it right the first time.|01-28-2015|capricorn
412|The most important thing today, tomorrow and over the weekend is that you resist the urge to compare yourself to other people. Life is not a contest where you have to be number one, so set yourself targets based on your own true desires.|01-29-2015|capricorn
413|Certain people may be making life tough for you for no apparent reason but that is no reason to feel sorry for yourself or start complaining that life is unfair. Of course it’s unfair, that’s part of the fun. Rise to the challenge and master it. |01-30-2015|capricorn
414|You would be wise not to take on any new duties over the next 48 hours. You would also be wise not to take your existing duties too seriously. There are more important things in life than worrying about everyday chores.|01-31-2015|capricorn
415|Don’t try to show your feelings for someone by splashing a load of cash on them. Not only is it not what they expect of you but you could put yourself in serious financial difficulties. They already know you love them.|02-01-2015|capricorn
416|Something unexpected will knock you out of your stride today and you will find it hard to get your rhythm back. Which may be frustrating but don’t make a big issue of it – just go off and do something different for a while. |02-02-2015|capricorn
417|If you get conflicting advice concerning business and money matters today you are advised to put off making decisions until later in the week. Don’t listen to those who say you must act now – they are thinking of themselves, not of you.|02-03-2015|capricorn
418|Do not allow yourself to get dragged into a dispute between friends or work colleagues. Even if you get involved out of good intentions you are likely to make an enemy of one side or the other, so keep your distance.|02-04-2015|capricorn
419|Someone will make you a rather tempting offer today but if you are smart you will demand a lot more. According to the planets they want you on board so much they can probably be persuaded to up their offer substantially. |02-05-2015|capricorn
420|If you go to extremes over the next 24 hours you are sure to provoke a strong reaction. Maybe that’s what you are hoping to do but is that wise? Try to find a more socially acceptable outlet for your ambition and aggression. |02-06-2015|capricorn
421|Others can be as miserable as they please this weekend but you intend to have a really good time. Travel and socialize and laugh often. Those around you won’t be miserable for long – how can they be when you’re so full of fun?|02-07-2015|capricorn
422|Weigh your options carefully before taking action this week. It would appear that a rival or competitor has set up a trap hoping you will blunder into it, but you’re not so easily fooled. Maybe you should set a trap for them.|02-08-2015|capricorn
423|You need to let someone know that you are under no obligation to do their bidding. This may come as a surprise to them as you have allowed them to get away with so much, but it’s time to draw a line in the sand. |02-09-2015|capricorn
424|You may find it hard to get a straight answer from a friend or work colleague today but don’t let it bother you. The fact is you don’t need their input, still less their permission, so stop trying to be so polite. |02-10-2015|capricorn
425|Something that has been tormenting you these past few weeks will no longer seem such a problem after today. You will also be delighted to discover that you are not as poor financially as you thought you were. |02-11-2015|capricorn
426|Pace yourself sensibly and don’t force yourself to do things simply because other people expect you to do them. If you don’t have the energy or the inclination to do a certain task then don’t do it. No one can make you.|02-12-2015|capricorn
427|You seem to know just the right thing to say to get people on your side. Make that work in your favor today, especially when dealing with money matters. Your way with words could make you, and save you, a pile of cash.|02-13-2015|capricorn
428|You may feel a bit hard done by, even that certain people are using you for their own ends, but don’t make an issue of it. In a matter of days their power over you will wane and you will be free to chart your own course again.|02-14-2015|capricorn
429|You have become too predictable of late and need to break out of your rut and make your routines less habitual. Start by doing something completely out of character, something you have never done before (and may never do again). |02-15-2015|capricorn
430|It may seem as if you are powerless in the face of forces you don’t really understand but once the Sun changes signs in midweek you will find ways to start fighting back. Make sure you pick the right targets – not everyone is the enemy. |02-16-2015|capricorn
431|You can blame other people for what has gone wrong but wouldn’t it be more honest to look at your own performance first? You don’t usually pass the buck so easily, so why start now? Everyone makes mistakes – yes, even a Capricorn! |02-17-2015|capricorn
432|Aim to be on the move today because it is the people you meet along the way who will make things happen for you. Communications of all kinds will also go well, so let partners and colleagues know what you need.|02-18-2015|capricorn
433|Someone you live or work with will tell you something you don’t want to hear today but deep down you know that it’s true. Swallow your pride and act on the information – it could save you a lot of trouble later on.|02-19-2015|capricorn
434|Mars in the domestic sector of your chart is likely to spark family squabbles of one sort or another but they are really not that important. Also, with Venus working in your favor you can quite easily calm things down. Be the voice of reason.|02-20-2015|capricorn
435|Try not to be too critical of other people today, even if their efforts are not up to your standards. Partners and loved ones need your support, as do the people you work alongside. Boost their confidence, don’t wreck it.|02-21-2015|capricorn
436|Make sure no one is left in any doubt what it is you mean. Words are powerful and if you choose your words wisely over the next seven days there is no telling what you might accomplish. First though, know what it is you desire. |02-22-2015|capricorn
437|What a friend or relative tells you today may not be what you were hoping to hear but it is good advice and if you are smart you will listen and learn. If you are not so smart you could make a big mistake – and learn the hard way. |02-23-2015|capricorn
438|You are having doubts about something that only a short while ago you thought was a great idea. Be don’t give up on it yet, because a few days from now your doubts will be gone and it will be a great idea all over again.|02-24-2015|capricorn
439|If you need to say something difficult, something that might upset a few people, say it now rather than later. The Sun in the communications area of your chart will help you find the words to convey your meaning without being too hurtful. |02-25-2015|capricorn
440|Make the most of your newfound freedom to get out into the world and explore. Do something you have not been able to do for quite some time today. You will enjoy it immensely, especially if others tell you it is still forbidden.|02-26-2015|capricorn
441|Be extra careful when dealing with people in positions of authority today. It does not matter that you are in the right, what matters is that they have the power. Don’t make it easy for them to make life difficult for you.|02-27-2015|capricorn
442|Be careful when dealing with employers and people in positions of authority this weekend because if you say or do something they consider disrespectful they are unlikely to be very forgiving. Don’t pick fights you cannot possibly win.|02-28-2015|capricorn
443|Be nice to everyone, even people you don’t like very much. Someone who is a rival now could become a friend and ally by the end of the week. It seems you have a lot in common – and maybe a common enemy too. |03-01-2015|capricorn
444|You will discover something about a friend that makes you understand why they have been behaving so strangely of late. Keep what you find to yourself. It may be no big deal to you but obviously it is important to them. |03-02-2015|capricorn
445|Some kind of upheaval will take place today and because you like things to stay as they are you won’t be happy about it. However, this particular upheaval comes with an opportunity attached, so stay switched on. You could make some money.|03-03-2015|capricorn
446|If you have something to say make sure you say it loud and clear. Don’t worry that by speaking your mind you might damage your career prospects – it’s a risk worth taking and could actually have the opposite effect. People will admire your integrity.|03-04-2015|capricorn
447|You will find it hard to make up your mind as to what it is you should be doing today but that’s okay. The planets indicate there is no need to rush – in fact the longer you put off making a decision the better.|03-05-2015|capricorn
448|You are in a hugely positive mood at the moment and that’s good because there is so much that needs to be done. But don’t try to do it all in one go because even if you succeed you will exhaust yourself and ruin your weekend.|03-06-2015|capricorn
449|By all means go out and enjoy yourself this weekend. Others may say you are being irresponsible, that there are chores that need to be done, but even if they are right you can quite easily get them done another day. Only do what makes you smile.|03-07-2015|capricorn
450|Someone you live or work with is in need of your help and you will go out of your way to assist them. But make sure they are not taking advantage of you for purely selfish reasons. You can sometimes be too sympathetic for your own good.|03-08-2015|capricorn
451|You may feel out of touch with the spirit of the times but is that such a bad thing? Looking around at the world you might come to the conclusion that the times are not as good as they should be. So how can you make them better? |03-09-2015|capricorn
452|Follow your intuition over the next 24 hours, even if it leads you in a strange new direction. And remember: just because a lot of people are moving down one particular path does not mean it is the right path, at least not for you.|03-10-2015|capricorn
453|There is no point getting involved in something you know you won’t enjoy, so be brave and let those who are trying to persuade you to get involved know that you are having none of it. Always be true to who and what you are.|03-11-2015|capricorn
454|You are in one of your negative moods. You are convinced that the roof is going to fall in on you at any moment. So it will come as a nice surprise today when the roof stays where it is and something wonderful happens instead.|03-12-2015|capricorn
455|Others may be impressed by your air of self-confidence but what they don’t know is that it’s a bit of an act, you don’t feel that confident at all. Having said which, Mercury’s change of signs today will give your self-belief a boost. |03-13-2015|capricorn
456|Something you have been struggling with mentally will resolve itself this weekend. Your mind will come up with the right explanation and you will kick yourself for not having thought of it sooner. Never mind, you know now and that’s what counts.|03-14-2015|capricorn
457|There are so many things you want to say but for one reason or another cannot find the words. Don’t worry, the approaching solar eclipse will help you get your message across – in fact once you start talking you may not be able to stop! |03-15-2015|capricorn
458|Why do some people get hysterical over such minor matters? Why can’t everyone be calm and controlled like you? Whatever the reason it’s unlikely they are going to change, so make allowances and, where possible, stay out of their way. |03-16-2015|capricorn
459|If someone says something that annoys you today you must let them know you are not amused. If you let them get away with it once they will no doubt be tempted to bad mouth you again later on. Nip it in the bud.|03-17-2015|capricorn
460|You may not be in the mood to compromise at the moment but the fact is you are going to have to, especially on the home front where loved ones can dig in their heels just as effectively as you. Meet them halfway.|03-18-2015|capricorn
461|You can sense that something good is going to happen but there is no need to hurry it along. Venus, planet of harmony, in your fellow Earth sign of Taurus means the right opportunity will arrive at just the right time, so be patient.|03-19-2015|capricorn
462|In the wider scheme of things there is no such thing as coincidence and if you feel yourself drawn towards a certain person it is because your fates are connected. Together you can find what apart you have searched for in vain. |03-20-2015|capricorn
463|Partners and loved ones seem to be giving you the silent treatment at the moment. Why? What have you done wrong? The only way you are going to find out is to ask them. Most likely it’s just a misunderstanding. You’ll laugh about it one day. |03-21-2015|capricorn
464|This is an excellent time for all kinds of communications, so get out into the world and mix with as wide a range of people as you can. Don’t stay at home waiting for others to contact you – reach out and make contact yourself. |03-22-2015|capricorn
465|You like to prove yourself but the planets warn you could find yourself up against a force that is too big for even you to tame over the next 24 hours. Don’t upset people in positions of authority – the results could be painful. |03-23-2015|capricorn
466|This is a good time to start something creative or artistic. It may take up a lot of your time and require a considerable input of emotional and physical energy but that’s okay – what you get back will more than balance what you put in.|03-24-2015|capricorn
467|Venus in your fellow Earth sign of Taurus makes it much easier to express your feelings. Just be careful you don’t become infatuated with someone you have been too afraid to approach in the past. Your passion could cause problems. |03-25-2015|capricorn
468|Your confidence is improving and it won’t be long before your positive attitude brings positive results. Both in your personal life and at work people will sense your self-assurance and want to do things for you – and you must let them.|03-26-2015|capricorn
469|The intensity of your emotions could catch you by surprise today, so promise yourself now that you will stay in control and not overreact. If you do go too far you may be a bit embarrassed later when you realize what was said and done.|03-27-2015|capricorn
470|Someone who has helped you in the past won’t be able to help you this weekend, not because they don’t want to but because they have other things to deal with. In a way that’s good – it means you will have to learn to help yourself.|03-28-2015|capricorn
471|You know that a friend needs help and you would like to offer your assistance but their body language says “keep your distance”. There is nothing you can do but to respect their unspoken wish. Maybe they enjoy suffering in silence. |03-29-2015|capricorn
472|Work hard early in the day because the afternoon and evening will bring social opportunities you won’t want to miss. And if you don’t get everything done? Leave it until later in the week. Don’t burden yourself with unnecessary deadlines. |03-30-2015|capricorn
473|Mars in Taurus over the next few weeks will make you energetic in the extreme. Make the most of it to finish a project that should have been completed a long time ago. This could be the last chance you get|03-31-2015|capricorn
474|Mars in the most dynamic area of your chart makes all things possible, so forget about the things that went wrong and focus on the things that are going to go right. This is potentially a great time for you, so seize the initiative.|04-01-2015|capricorn
475|The more others say you should be careful the more determined you will be to take some kind of risk. Are you right or are they right? Only time will tell but, one way or the other, you will have fun finding out.|04-02-2015|capricorn
476|Don’t worry what others might think about what you are planning – if it feels right to you then nothing else matters. The approaching eclipse makes this a good time to rock the boat a bit. It’s unlikely to be you who falls out!|04-03-2015|capricorn
477|You must be totally honest with people you work with this weekend, even if they have the power to make things difficult for you if you fall out. If you bend the truth now it will come back and bite you later in the month.|04-04-2015|capricorn
478|You may take certain issues a bit too seriously over the next few days and arguments are likely, but it’s no big deal. In fact it could work in your favor in that you need to find something to let off steam about. Passion needs an outlet. |04-05-2015|capricorn
479|You will have to deal with some annoying people today but getting angry won’t make things any easier. Yes, of course, it’s a pain when others act slowly or stupidly but not everyone can be as switched on as you. Make allowances. |04-06-2015|capricorn
480|You are reading too many things into too many situations and it’s not healthy. Make it your aim today to think and analyze less and just go with the flow. It may not be your natural way but it is certainly the right way.|04-07-2015|capricorn
481|Try not to let your emotions get the better of you today. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to money matters. With Jupiter, planet of excess, moving through the wealth area of your chart it won’t be difficult to overreact.|04-08-2015|capricorn
482|Try not to be too critical of other people today, because however well meaning your comments may be if they sound too negative they won’t go down well. Loved ones, especially, need your support, not your criticism, so be positive.|04-09-2015|capricorn
483|You may want to help someone in need and you may know what is best for them but that does not mean you should force yourself on them. Some people prefer to suffer in silence than admit they need assistance. Respect their wishes.|04-10-2015|capricorn
484|Try not to get uptight if you come across someone whose attitude you disapprove of. If they really offend you that much just stay out of their way, but if you get chatting you may be surprised to discover you have things in common.|04-11-2015|capricorn
485|Pace yourself sensibly over the coming week and don’t force yourself to do anything simply because other people demand it of you. If you don’t have the desire to do a certain task then don’t do it – no one has the power to force you.|04-12-2015|capricorn
486|Try not to attach too much importance to what you hear from a friend or work colleague today because there is every chance they don’t know what they are talking about. Don’t make important decisions based on dubious “facts”. |04-13-2015|capricorn
487|You can turn almost any situation to your advantage over the next 24 hours. Mars in the most dynamic area of your chart means you are intensely ambitious – and it makes you more passionate than usual. Try mixing business with pleasure!|04-14-2015|capricorn
488|Don’t push yourself too hard or take on any new responsibilities over the next 24 hours – and don’t let other people talk you into doing things that are of no interest to you personally. It’s your life and you should be in control of it.|04-15-2015|capricorn
489|Don’t let anyone tell you that certain things cannot be done. What seems difficult, maybe even impossible, at this moment in time will become much easier when the Sun changes signs on Monday. Life never stands still and neither should you.|04-17-2015|capricorn
490|No matter what happens over the next 48 hours you must not lose your temper. It may be that you have to turn a blind eye to someone who is doing things you know to be wrong but peace of mind is your principal concern.|04-18-2015|capricorn
491|Forget about details and focus on the big questions of life. If possible, find a like-minded soul with whom you can discuss the meaning of the universe. If not, find a quiet spot where you can think about it on your own for a while. |04-19-2015|capricorn
492|Don’t push yourself too hard as the new week begins. The Sun’s move into the most dynamic area of your chart will fill you with energy and enthusiasm but you need to plan a bit too. What is your number one aim? Start working towards it.|04-20-2015|capricorn
493|Think big today, and for the rest of the week. The Sun in your fellow Earth sign of Taurus at this time of year makes all things possible, for you at least, so don’t limit yourself to petty ambitions. Go for gold.|04-21-2015|capricorn
494|The Sun and Mars are all working in your favor at the moment, so decide what it is you most want to accomplish then go all out to make it happen. Affairs of the heart are also well starred. Tell that special someone how much you love them.|04-22-2015|capricorn
495|Seize the initiative today and let everyone around you know that you intend to take what it is you desire rather than wait for others to give it to you. The Sun in Taurus makes all things possible, so there is no excuse for second best.|04-23-2015|capricorn
496|Have confidence in yourself by all means but don’t think that merely by turning up everyone else will back down and make it easy for you to win. They won’t. Confidence is important, of course, but so is having a plan and so is staying power.|04-24-2015|capricorn
497|You will clash with someone this weekend whose opinions you not only disagree with but actually detest and it could be a difficult situation for both of you. Sometimes in life you have to stand up and fight for what you believe in. |04-25-2015|capricorn
498|Anyone who gives you a hard time this week will soon wish they had been nice instead. You are in no mood to give warnings or second chances – the moment they overstep the mark there will be instant retribution. You’re scary when you’re like this! |04-26-2015|capricorn
499|If you take a risk of some kind over money today it may pay off, but even if it does you must not cast aside your usual cautious Capricorn nature. You of all people should know that it’s not about risk, it’s about hard work.|04-27-2015|capricorn
500|You will make efforts above and beyond the call of duty over the next 24 hours. The Sun and Mars in the most dynamic area of your chart makes you feel like you can take on the world and win. And you know what? You can!|04-28-2015|capricorn
501|The cosmic powers that be are very much on your side at the moment. What does that mean in practical terms? It means you can and you should do something memorable, something you will be remembered for in years to come.|04-29-2015|capricorn
502|It is one thing to dream but quite another to turn dreams into reality, so start thinking now about how you can take practical steps to make your current dream come true. You’ve had the inspiration, now what’s needed is some perspiration.|04-30-2015|capricorn
503|A task you have been putting off for ages will have to be dealt with over the next few days. The sooner you get started on it the sooner it will be done and then you can turn your attention to more enjoyable things. Get to it!|05-01-2015|capricorn
504|The problem you will face over the next 48 hours is very similar to a problem you faced a little while ago, so stop worrying and think back to how you got through it before. The past cannot be changed but you can always learn from it. |05-02-2015|capricorn
505|Some people bring out the best in you and others bring out the worst but ultimately only you can decide how to deal with them and what emotions you allow to develop. You are not and never will be a victim, so don’t act like one. |05-03-2015|capricorn
506|The pace of life will be hectic over the next few days and the demands others make of you will be tough. Now that you know that you can plan ahead sensibly and be ready to say “no” when too much is expected of you. |05-04-2015|capricorn
507|Are you feeling lucky? Hopefully you are because your state of mind will very much dictate what you gain, or lose, today. If you believe that you deserve the best then you will get it – it’s your mind that creates your reality.|05-05-2015|capricorn
508|This is generally a positive time for you but you still need to take care where your finances are concerned. Above all you should resist the temptation to spend money on luxuries and other things you know you cannot really afford. |05-06-2015|capricorn
509|Promise yourself here and now that no matter what happens today you won’t take it too seriously. Treat whatever occurs, be it “good” or be it “bad” as part of life’s little game. It’s your attitude that makes your world.|05-07-2015|capricorn
510|Say what you have to say as plainly as possible, so there can be no misunderstandings. That is not, however, an excuse to be rude and antagonize colleagues and friends. Straight talking is an art but it does not have to be a martial art! |05-08-2015|capricorn
511|You may be tempted to give up on a project that seems to have hit a wall but if you do you will regret it later. Keep at it and keep telling yourself it will come right in the end. Since when do Capricorns give in so easily? |05-09-2015|capricorn
512|As Mars moves into your opposite sign over the next few days you must expect partners and colleagues and loved ones to be more assertive than they have been of late. Don’t let them push you around – stand up for yourself. |05-10-2015|capricorn
513|Something you do – or don’t do – will shock those who see you as the one person who can always be depended on, but maybe that’s the idea. Maybe you’ve had enough of possessing the shoulder everyone leans on, at least for a while. |05-11-2015|capricorn
514|You may not be the life and soul of the party at the moment but don’t let it worry you. The less time you spend talking and socializing the more time you will have to think – and you will come up with some remarkable ideas.|05-12-2015|capricorn
515|You may be considering giving up on a project that appears to have run its course, but something will happen over the next few days that makes you think again. It could be there is a lot of mileage in it yet, so don’t give up so easily.|05-13-2015|capricorn
516|The Sun remains in the most dynamic area of your chart for one more week, which means you still have time to start something new. Pay no attention to those who counsel caution – your creative passion must not be limited in any way.|05-14-2015|capricorn
517|It does not matter that others say something cannot be done – if you want it enough you will find a way to get it. Stop worrying about where you have been and start looking ahead and planning where you are going to be.|05-15-2015|capricorn
518|Set your sights high and don’t settle for second best, either in your career or in your personal life. You may have to push yourself a little harder than usual this weekend but that’s okay – you have got plenty of energy in reserve.|05-16-2015|capricorn
519|No matter what you may have achieved in the past you will do something even better over the next few days. The people you meet on your travels will do just about anything for you, so ask yourself what it is you really want. |05-17-2015|capricorn
520|Most things will come easy to you this week but that does not mean you will sit back and not make much of an effort. On the contrary, today’s new moon means you are even more dynamic and decisive than usual, and that’s saying something. |05-18-2015|capricorn
521|Whatever you are working on now you must make a good job of it. If you try to get away with less than perfect work you will most likely have to go back and do it all again later on while your friends are having fun.|05-19-2015|capricorn
522|Over the next few days you will need to get a bit more serious about your work and your wellbeing. Not that there is anything much to worry about but you do need to pace yourself better. You don’t have to move so fast.|05-20-2015|capricorn
523|You may have to make some minor adjustments to your working routine over the next few days but that’s okay. The more you change now the less you will have to change later on, and what you do change will work out perfectly for you.|05-21-2015|capricorn
524|If life seems too complicated of late it is most likely because you are making it too complicated. How do you make it simpler? Do less – a lot less. Cut back to essentials and don’t waste time or energy on complicated ideas or activities.|05-22-2015|capricorn
525|You probably won’t believe what a loved one tells you over the next 48 hours but don’t make a big deal of it because if you call them a liar it will seriously sour the mood. Pretend you agree with every word they say. |05-23-2015|capricorn
526|If you need assistance then you must speak up. Yes, it would be nice if friends and relatives could read your mind and come to the rescue without being asked but it doesn’t happen like that. Would you really want them knowing your thoughts?|05-24-2015|capricorn
527|Venus in the partnership area of your chart urges you to let loved ones know exactly how you feel about them – and yes, your feelings are warm and deep. Most likely they know already, of course, but it never hurts to spell it out.|05-25-2015|capricorn
528|You seem to be under the impression that you can get away with anything. It may or may not be true but either way it’s not a wise attitude to take. Life is good and getting better by the moment – don’t take risks that could spoil it. |05-26-2015|capricorn
