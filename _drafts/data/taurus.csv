0|For some reason you appear reluctant to accept an offer of assistance from a friend or work colleague. According to the planets you are right to be suspicious, so listen to your sixth sense and do only what it tells you.|12-01-2013|pisces
1|It may appear as if you are the only one making sacrifices for a relationship but the planets warn you are not seeing the situation clearly. Don’t start complaining or you may lose the one person who makes your world a better place.|12-02-2013|pisces
2|You are being far too pessimistic about your chances. In all things there is a natural ebb and flow and if you are on the down side of the curve at the moment you are sure to be on the up again by the end of the week.|12-03-2013|pisces
3|The only thing to fear is fear itself, so put your doubts behind you and plunge headlong into the unknown. That might not sound like a typically Taurus thing to do but, seriously, what have you got to lose? Take a chance.|12-04-2013|pisces
4|What you focus your attention on today will seem more important than it really is, so make sure you focus on positive things. Your mind is a powerful tool and can create happiness as easily as it creates sadness. Remember that. |12-05-2013|pisces
5|Too often in the past you have held back while those with considerably less talent have achieved the kind of success that should have been yours. It’s time to shed your inhibitions and let the world see what a star you really are.|12-06-2013|pisces
6|You won’t lack for confidence today but you may lack for common sense, so don’t push your luck too far. On the work front, especially, you need to be aware that certain people do not have your best interests at heart.|12-07-2013|pisces
7|Keep your eye on money matters and business issues and make sure you are not being duped by people who would quite happily get rich at your expense. It would be nice if everyone was as honest as you but the fact is they’re not.|12-08-2013|pisces
8|There is a lot of pressure on you at the moment, the sort that would make other people crack. But you’re not other people, you’re a Taurus, and giving in and giving up are not in your nature. What’s the worst that can happen? You can handle it.|12-09-2013|pisces
9|Be careful what you say if someone comes to you for advice. Make sure what you tell them comes from your own experience and is not something you picked up from an unreliable source. If you don’t know the answer, just say so.|12-10-2013|pisces
10|If you need to get something finished you had better step on the gas. Mars in the work area of your chart will boost your energy levels but you won’t get anywhere worth going unless you are motivated. Remind yourself what it’s all for.|12-11-2013|pisces
11|It may at times seem as if you are not making much progress but in a matter of days there will be clear signs that you are on the verge of a major breakthrough. Keep looking ahead and keep doing what makes you feel good.|12-12-2013|pisces
12|Expect your workload to increase a lot over the next 24 hours. That may not sound like good news but at least it shows that important people trust you to get the job done. Looks like you’re the only one they can rely on.|12-13-2013|pisces
13|Don’t let your tendency to fear the worst get out of hand and spoil what otherwise promises to be a good weekend. If anxiety starts to bite just stop, count to ten, and remind yourself of all the things you have to be thankful for.|12-14-2013|pisces
14|Your money situation looks worse than it really is, so resist the urge to make major changes. Yes, cutbacks of some kind will be necessary in the long-term but now is not the best time to start them as you are not thinking straight.|12-15-2013|pisces
15|Speak up if you have something important to say but make sure you listen too because the feedback you get could be invaluable. Also, someone you meet on your travels will come up with an idea that you take to immediately|12-16-2013|pisces
16|You may feel compelled to accept what is being offered but if you are not happy with the terms you must speak up or there will be trouble further down the line. You are not being selfish by holding out for more. Do what’s best for you.|12-17-2013|pisces
17|You will have to do something that makes you unpopular but if you don’t do it now you may have to do something twice as bad later on. Put duty before pleasure and make sure you are on top of your workload.|12-18-2013|pisces
18|You may resent having to pay for something you think you should get for free but if you make a scene you may end up paying even more. Don’t be such a miser. Put your hand in your pocket. It’s only money after all.|12-19-2013|pisces
19|If you find yourself up against a tough opponent today you should back off and live to fight another day. The planets warn this is a battle you cannot win and if you cannot win then the only sensible course is to withdraw, for now.|12-20-2013|pisces
20|This is a good time for affairs of the heart and if you are in the market for love you might just meet someone who floats your boat. However, the planets warn it won’t be all plain sailing, so be ready to brave a few storms.|12-21-2013|pisces
21|Make quick work of any money matters or business issues that have to be dealt with, then turn your attention to having fun with your friends. Travel of one sort or another is on the cards over the next few weeks, so start packing.|12-22-2013|pisces
22|This is a fortunate time of year for you, so why the feeling of impending doom? Whatever it is that is making you jittery put it out of your mind because it does not have the power to hurt you. Work is the best remedy for worry.|12-23-2013|pisces
23|You will handle anything and everything life throws at you with grace and style. The planets endow you with limitless self-confidence and the kind of faith that moves mountains. Make the most of it – and make your mark on the world.|12-24-2013|pisces
24|It will pay you to be skeptical about what you are told today, especially if the person who is doing the telling is a rival of some sort. The more they assure you there is nothing to worry about the more you should check for yourself.|12-25-2013|pisces
25|You need a change of perspective and a change of direction and the planets will see that you get it. But don’t worry: you will like what the next few weeks bring your way very much indeed. Be positive and welcome new opportunities.|12-26-2013|pisces
26|This promises to be a special day for you, even more so if you are socializing or traveling. It is also a good day to patch things up romantically. Whatever problems you had in the past put them behind you and move on.|12-27-2013|pisces
27|You are about to be made an offer you won’t want to refuse but some individuals will go out of their way to persuade you that it’s not in your interests. Don’t listen to them. They are jealous because you are attracting so much good fortune.|12-28-2013|pisces
28|The Sun in Capricorn gives your confidence a boost but confidence alone won’t get you where you want to go. The approaching new moon will remind you that no matter how determined you may be you still need powerful friends.|12-30-2013|pisces
29|Something will happen today that others think is of mega-importance. You, however, can see the situation for what it truly is: just another minor drama in a long line of minor dramas. It’s not worth getting worked up about. |12-31-2013|pisces
30|There is nothing you cannot do and no one you cannot impress. Today’s new moon in Capricorn means not only that you are full of confidence but that friends, colleagues and loved ones will go out of their way to assist you too.|01-01-2014|pisces
31|Cosmic activity in the work and well being area of your chart warns youmust be careful not to over do it today. Youmay have a thousand and one things to do but you won’t get them all done at once. There’s always tomorrow.|01-02-2014|pisces
32|The planets will bring to light a solution to a personal or professional problem you thought was here to stay. You should know by now that nothing is impossible: Everything worth knowing is revealed over time, so be patient.|01-03-2014|pisces
33|Minor disputes could escalate into major disagreements over the next 48 hours, so try not to react emotionally to what you see or hear. No matter what happens, at home or at work, keep telling yourself it’s not nearly as bad as it looks.|01-04-2014|pisces
34|This is a great time to be on the move, for business or for pleasure. The more people you meet the more likely it is you will learn something to your advantage. Contacts with unusual people could be especially profitable this week.|01-05-2014|pisces
35|A relationship that has fallen into a rut can be spiced up again but it won’t happen if you keep looking back to the past. Once you accept that it will never be the way it was you can start making it even better for the future.|01-06-2014|pisces
36|You seem to think the worst is going to happen. You seem to think the sky is going to fall on your head. You should know by now that is exactly the sort of thought pattern that encourages bad things to happen. Be positive. |01-07-2014|pisces
37|Honest effort always gets results, so keep plugging away at what you are working on and don’t get dispirited if results are slow in coming. Nothing you do is ever wasted and one day soon you will make that breakthrough you long for.|01-08-2014|pisces
38|You will be inspired to give of your best over the next 24 hours, no matter what it might be you are working on. Hold on to that positive, can-do attitude as long as you can, ideally until the moon is full seven days from now.|01-09-2014|pisces
39|Even a Taurus needs to take a break now and again and the planets indicate this is the perfect time to sit quietly and ponder the meaning of your existence. If that sounds a bit too intellectual, just plan your next big vacation.|01-10-2014|pisces
40||01-11-2014|pisces
41|If you change your mind about something over the next few days you will only change it back again towards the end of the month when you realize you have got facts and figures completely wrong. Stick with what you already know.|01-12-2014|pisces
42|Don’t listen to those who counsel caution. The only reason they don’t want you to do anything adventurous is because they are worried it will make them look bad. And they’re right, it will – which is all the more reason to do it.|01-13-2014|pisces
43|Over the next few days it will feel like you have turned a corner, that better days are coming. They probably won’t arrive for a few weeks yet but because you know they are on their way you can start making plans. Make them big.|01-14-2014|pisces
44|You would like nothing better than to turn your back on the past and start again but you know it isn’t practical. The planets urge you to make the most of the situation you find yourself in: it’s not as bad as you seem to believe.|01-15-2014|pisces
45|Any plans you make now are under the influence of the full moon, so try not to take them too seriously. A lot depends on whether you made them rationally or emotionally. If it was the latter, they may have to be changed.|01-16-2014|pisces
46|Something will happen today that to begin with annoys you, but when you calm down and think about it you will realize that it makes no difference to your plans. Carry on with what you were going to do – and do it brilliantly.|01-17-2014|pisces
47|Over the next few days you will become increasingly focused on your position in the wider world. Most likely you will feel you could be making more of your talents and you’re right, you could. It’s time to move up a gear.|01-18-2014|pisces
48|There will be several opportunities to boost your reputation and move up in the world over the coming week. But don’t think you have to fight every inch of the way. Turn on the charm – you’ll be amazed how far it takes you.|01-19-2014|pisces
49|Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart will do your reputation a power of good over the next few days, so put your doubts behind you and show the world you have what it takes. Work hard but don’t forget to play hard too.|01-20-2014|pisces
50|This is the perfect time to enhance your status and give your reputation a boost. You will find favor with people in positions of power but the most important thing is that you believe in yourself – then others will believe in you too.|01-21-2014|pisces
51|If there is something you have been trying to do but every time you get started something forces you to stop, it could be a sign you should be doing something else. Maybe the planets are trying to push you in a more rewarding direction.|01-22-2014|pisces
52|You will fall out with someone who does not share your aims and opinions. It’s just as well. The longer you go on pretending that you can work together despite your differences the less likely it is you will get any serious work done.|01-23-2014|pisces
53|Why are you so excitable? Whatever the reason you will be on the go from dawn to dusk today. You may need to rest and get your energy back tomorrow but for now you are a ball of energy that cannot be contained. Do something extraordinary.|01-24-2014|pisces
54|You may be wondering if you have taken on too much or taken too much for granted. Ignore any fears you may have because this is only a temporary loss of self-belief and soon you will be taking on even bigger challenges.|01-25-2014|pisces
55|You will find it much easier than usual to come up with big ideas this week, which is sure to impress employers and other important people. And that’s good because there is a new moon this week and that means new opportunities.|01-26-2014|pisces
56|You have been worrying about something for no good reason and what happens over the next few days will convince you that you have in fact been rather lucky. That luck will continue as someone makes you an offer you won’t want to refuse.|01-27-2014|pisces
57|You have your sights fixed on certain goals and won’t give up until you have reached them. However, cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs dreams and desires warns you need to get your ego out of the way. Let others guide you.|01-28-2014|pisces
58|You may be determined to discover the truth about something you believe others have been covering up, but don’t start reading fanciful stuff into situations that are really quite normal. You may have suspicions, but keep them to yourself.|01-29-2014|pisces
59|If you need to ask a favor of someone in a position of authority now is the time. Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart makes it easy for you to approach employers and other important people. Flatter them shamelessly.|01-30-2014|pisces
60|Something will seize your imagination today and before you know it you will be moving in a new direction. Does what you are doing have any practical or financial value? Who cares! It’s about enjoyment, not what you own or earn.|01-31-2014|pisces
61|The questions you are asking yourself now may be the same questions you were asking yourself yesterday and the day before that but you will get completely different answers. How do you know what is true and what is false? Trust your instincts.|02-01-2014|pisces
62|If you were planning something spectacular for the next few days it might pay you to think again, especially if there is money involved. The planets indicate there is no need to rush things – you are making good progress already.|02-03-2014|pisces
63|You may find it hard to believe what you hear today but don’t reject it out of hand because it may be true. Reserve judgment until later in the week when there are more facts available – though, of course, “facts” can be flexible too.|02-04-2014|pisces
64|Two weeks from now, when the Sun moves into one of the more positive areas of your chart, you will get the chance to do your own thing. Until then, though, you have to accept that others are still calling the shots. Stay calm. |02-05-2014|pisces
65|Do you go out and have fun or do you stay in and get some work done? If you are smart – and you are, you are – you will sacrifice short-term enjoyment for long-term peace of mind. In other words: get that work finished.|02-06-2014|pisces
66|Do you carry on with a difficult task or do you end it and focus on something a bit easier? Only you can decide but it does seem a bit of a waste to give up on it so soon. What happened to that Taurus staying power?|02-07-2014|pisces
67|Someone will tell you something you find hard to take seriously this weekend, but don’t dismiss it out of hand. If you dig a bit deeper you may find there is a nugget of truth in what they are saying, so try not to be too skeptical.|02-08-2014|pisces
68|Don’t be afraid to admit that you are out of your depth. The moment you speak up you will have friends and family members rushing to assist you, so why suffer in silence? You’ve helped others so often in the past – now let them help you.|02-10-2014|pisces
69|Whatever your ambitions may be right now, they will change dramatically over the next few weeks. Whatever happens you must believe that you are more than just a cog in the machine. You have the poise and the power to make a difference. |02-11-2014|pisces
70|You don’t find it easy to let others make decisions for you but today and tomorrow you are advised to put yourself in other people’s hands and let them call the shots. The planets indicate you won’t lose a thing. You may even win.|02-12-2014|pisces
71|If you say one thing but do another you leave yourself open to charges of hypocrisy. You don’t need to cut corners or bend the truth: you have so much going for you that you will still come out ahead of the game however you play it.|02-13-2014|pisces
72|You like to aim high and get on in the world but sometimes you wonder if it’s worth the effort. Only you can decide but now is not a good time to make decisions concerning either your career or your family. Think about it another day.|02-14-2014|pisces
73|There is a solution to every problem and although the problem that confronts you this weekend may seem daunting if you stay calm and stick to the facts you will find a way to overcome it. The trick is to use your head, not lose it.|02-15-2014|pisces
74|People in authority seem to favor you and because of that you can get away with most things but as from tomorrow they will expect you to become more of a team player. Can you do that? Of course you can – it’s in your interests.|02-17-2014|pisces
75|As the Sun moves into in the area of your chart that governs your hopes and wishes, your dreams and aspirations, you cannot help but raise your sights and aim for something better in life. Be ready to make serious changes – and sacrifices.|02-18-2014|pisces
76|You would be wise to keep your cash in your pocket today, because if you make one wrong move you may have to make several more to cover it up, and before you know what’s happening it will be costing you a fortune. Play safe. |02-19-2014|pisces
77|Aim to make new friends over the next 24 hours, especially with people whose interests are in some way out of the ordinary. It’s not true that Taurus is old-fashioned or has conservative tastes – in fact you can be a bit of a rebel.|02-20-2014|pisces
78|Patience and a sense of humor are a must today. Something is about to happen that not only takes you by surprise but makes your plans redundant, much to your annoyance. Something else you may need: a sense of perspective.|02-21-2014|pisces
79|There seem to be lots of hard luck stories about at the moment and you know that not a single one of them is true. You may be kind and generous by nature but anyone who asks for help this weekend may be out of luck.|02-22-2014|pisces
80|A particular group of people may seem completely different to you but you have more in common with them than you realize. What happens this week will awaken you to the fact that you should be working, and laughing, together more often.|02-23-2014|pisces
81|The line between fantasy and reality sometimes gets a bit blurred and there is a danger you could accidentally cross that line and do something foolish today. If you do make a mistake make sure you learn the lesson it has for you.|02-24-2014|pisces
82|You need to find ways to further your ambitions while not appearing too pushy or too selfish. This may be a time of great uncertainty but it is also a time of great opportunity. Stay calm, stay focused and, above all, stay the course.|02-25-2014|pisces
83|You seem to be hesitating and putting off something you know you will enjoy. Why is that? Whatever the reason you need to get started on it some time soon. Don’t worry that there may be an element of risk involved – that’s part of the fun.|02-26-2014|pisces
84|According to the planets you could make some serious money, but first you need to get serious about your ambitions. Most of all you need to commit yourself to an objective that may take years to reach. Give it some thought.|02-27-2014|pisces
85|Keep telling yourself that you have what it takes. Keep telling yourself that you will succeed. If you say it enough you will start to believe it and when that happens all sorts of doors will suddenly open to you. It’s all about your mind.|02-28-2014|pisces
86|Focus your mind on what it is you want to accomplish in life, because with a new moon and the power of Jupiter to help you there is every chance your dream will soon be a reality – even more so if you team up with like-minded people.|03-01-2014|pisces
87|You can influence people on the work front with ease this week, simply by being yourself. As Venus, your ruler, moves into the career area of your chart you will find it ridiculously easy to charm your way to success. So do it.|03-02-2014|pisces
88|If you take a risk over the next 24 hours it will more than likely pay off, maybe in a big way. Remember: no matter how powerful or how strong your rivals may be you have what they do not – staying power and a total lack of fear.|03-03-2014|pisces
89|You may be tempted to give up on something that just won’t go the way you want it to go. Don’t. Later this week something will happen that makes you realize that your slow progress is just a temporary blip – a necessary one too.|03-04-2014|pisces
90|Now is the time to prove yourself. Now is the time to show the world what you are capable of. With your ruler Venus moving into the career area of your chart today you will impress people of power with ease – IF you make the effort.|03-05-2014|pisces
91|You know what you want and you know how and where to get it, so all you have to do now is reach out your hand and take it. Sounds easy doesn’t it? Well that’s because it is. There can be no more excuses – make things happen!|03-06-2014|pisces
92|You may be willing to change your plans to help someone out today but don’t let them, or anyone else, tell you that you are obliged to do so. Let them know this is a one-off situation. After today they must look out for themselves.|03-07-2014|pisces
93|What happens over the next 48 hours, no matter how unexpected or how unsettling, will work in your favor in the long-term, so don’t fight it. And don’t get upset with a friend just because they disagree with you about something. It’s allowed!|03-08-2014|pisces
94|You need to shut yourself off from the world and be alone with your thoughts for a while. Others may wonder why you are suddenly so anti-social but they will give you the time and the space that you need. They owe you.|03-09-2014|pisces
95|Speak your mind today. Let the world know what you think. If certain people don’t like it that’s just too bad – in fact it’s a good sign. Jupiter in the communications area of your chart indicates that your words will have the desired effect.|03-10-2014|pisces
96|Make sure you base partnerships, both personal and professional, on mutual respect, because if you try to take liberties with friends, loved ones or work colleagues today you could pay dearly for it around the time of the full moon on the 16th.|03-11-2014|pisces
97|What comes to light in an unexpected manner today will most likely improve your bargaining position. It will also remind you that you don’t have to do it all on your own, that you have friends you can count on in a crisis.|03-12-2014|pisces
98|It’s okay if you want to shut yourself off from the world and be alone with your thoughts for a while – it’s allowed. Others may think you are behaving strangely but only because they are insensitive. They don’t possess your imagination.|03-13-2014|pisces
99|Use your imagination today. This is a great time for trying new things and adopting new methods, especially on the work front where, if you show you are able to adapt quickly to changing circumstances, you could be up for a promotion.|03-14-2014|pisces
100|This could be a tense weekend as family and work colleagues seem less than friendly for no obvious reason. Don’t worry about it. Most likely it has nothing to do with you. Most likely it’s just the full moon getting them down. It will pass.|03-15-2014|pisces
101|You may be a bit impulsive over the next few days but that is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact it could be a good thing if it means your efforts get noticed by people in positions of authority. Show them what you are capable of.|03-16-2014|pisces
102|Your mind may be bubbling with great ideas but what are they worth if you don’t do anything with them? If you want to get serious, if you want to make a difference in the world, it will take more than just ideas – it will take commitment.|03-17-2014|pisces
103|Someone in a position of authority will ask you to do something extra for them today and if you are smart you will agree. You may not be in the mood to work harder but later you will look back and realize how much it benefited you.|03-18-2014|pisces
104|It will benefit you to keep your plans to yourself today. Whatever information you may have that others do not you should treat it like gold dust. The less others know about what you are up to the more you will benefit.|03-19-2014|pisces
105|Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart means you may tend to fear the worst over the next few days, but that is quite natural. How good or how bad you feel is really down to you alone. Promise yourself you’ll smile more.|03-20-2014|pisces
106|You may have to remind a certain individual that you do not exist merely to be there when they call. Today’s lunar eclipse of Saturn in your opposite sign will help you express negative feelings in a positive way – positive for you, at least.|03-21-2014|pisces
107|What happens over the next few days might just transform the way you look at the world. The simple fact is you have been taking too much for granted and have been too trusting of those in positions of power. Start asking questions.|03-22-2014|pisces
108|If a friend or relative needs lifting mentally don’t wait to be asked – jump right in and do what you can to cheer them up. Your optimistic attitude will bring a smile to their face and it won’t be long before they believe in themselves again. |03-23-2014|pisces
109|The omens are good for you now, so why do you still seem to think that something bad is about to happen? What you need to realize is that if you think like that you increase the chances that it will happen that way. Be positive.|03-24-2014|pisces
110|You certainly have plenty of energy at your disposal but are you using it wisely? The planets will enable you to push harder and get more things done today but give some thought to your health as well. Don’t go to extremes.|03-25-2014|pisces
111|Social activities will go well today, so make an effort to get out and about and meet new people. The more things you do with others the more you will enjoy yourself and the more of an effect your actions will have on the world.|03-26-2014|pisces
112|Do you get involved in a feud between friends or do you keep your distance? You know the answer already, so don’t be silly and stand between them and try to keep the peace. If you do, quite probably they will gang up on you.|03-27-2014|pisces
113|The planets will give you the confidence to step into the spotlight and let important people know what you are capable of. Don’t worry that they might think you are being too pushy because that’s just what they are looking for.|03-28-2014|pisces
114|What you think is a problem is not really a problem at all and what happens next will help you recognize that fact. What is also a fact is that, despite what the doomsayers might say, the sky is not about to fall, at least not on you.|03-29-2014|pisces
115|You may want to believe that everyone is as honest as you but, of course, it isn’t true. The planets warn you will need to be on your guard, especially when the Sun squares up to Jupiter on Tuesday. Don’t trust everything you hear. |03-30-2014|pisces
116|You may be more robust than many but some people are ridiculously sensitive and you would be wise to keep that fact in mind today. If you want to get things done you should make it a policy to say nice things only, for now.|03-31-2014|pisces
117|There is no point getting worked up over something you can’t do much about. Having said that, while you may not be able to change things on a social or political level you can change things on a personal level. Just be a better person.|04-01-2014|pisces
118|What others tell you may seem reasonable but if something does not ring true you would be wise to be cautious. Most likely you are wrong to be so suspicions but today’s cosmic set-up warns it’s not a good idea to take chances.|04-02-2014|pisces
119|The planets will make it easy for you to complete a task that needs to be got out of the way as soon as possible. If you focus all your energy in a single direction today there is no telling what you might accomplish.|04-03-2014|pisces
120|You may be tempted to hit back at someone who has been spreading gossip about you but is it worth it? If you say something rude in return they will see they have managed to get under your skin. Just ignore them – that will hurt more.|04-04-2014|pisces
121|Yours may not be the most flexible sign of the zodiac but like it or not you will have to bend with the breeze over the next 48 hours. Don’t try to resist forces that are too strong for you or they will blow you clean away.|04-05-2014|pisces
122|No matter what you are offered over the next seven days you must not do anything that goes against your principles. You won’t be happy with yourself if you discover later on that others have suffered as a result of your actions.|04-06-2014|pisces
123|Sometimes you can be a bit offhand in your attitude and the planets warn you need to be more respectful if you want to get ahead. In everything you say and do try to work out how other people are likely to take it.|04-07-2014|pisces
124|It may seem as if your time and energy has been wasted but that’s not true. In fact, by the end of the week you will realize that you have gained in unexpected ways. In the long-term no effort is truly wasted. You should know that by now.|04-08-2014|pisces
125|Make sure you keep track of where your money is coming from and, just as importantly, where it is going to, over the next few days. Most people are trustworthy, of course, but someone may conveniently “forget” what they owe you.|04-09-2014|pisces
126|This may not be an easy time of year for you but you can sense that the day will soon be here when your luck turns for the better. Maybe that day will come sooner if you act as if nothing could possibly go wrong.|04-10-2014|pisces
127|Why are you trying to swim against the tide when you know it’s a battle you are destined to lose? You may not agree with the way things are going but common sense says you have no choice but to go with it, for now.|04-11-2014|pisces
128|Don’t let your responsibilities weigh you down. You may have no option but to work hard and help other people but you don’t have to push yourself beyond your natural limits. Physically, emotionally and mentally you must be kind to yourself.|04-12-2014|pisces
129|What you choose to do over the next seven days will to a large extent determine what the next six months or so are going to be like. The most important thing now is that you tie up loose ends, both in your personal life and in your career.|04-13-2014|pisces
130|You may have your suspicions about someone but the planets warn this is probably not the right time to go public with them. Even if your suspicions are correct you should keep your thoughts to yourself, at least for the time being.|04-14-2014|pisces
131|Are you working more for other people than you are for yourself? If so then it’s time to get a grip on the situation. Let those who are taking advantage of your generous nature know that this is as far as it goes – and mean it.|04-15-2014|pisces
132|Refuse to get uptight about the little things that sometimes go wrong. Both at home and at work it will seem as if people are deliberately letting you down but the truth is everyone is a bit confused at the moment, so make allowances.|04-16-2014|pisces
133|You may like to give the impression that you are immune to criticism but it’s not true and what someone says today will hurt you deeply. Could it be it hurts so much because, deep down, you know there might be some truth in it?|04-17-2014|pisces
134|You won’t have to try hard to make an impression today – with your ruler Venus making positive links to major planets everyone will think you are someone special. If you’re not already flavor of the month, you very soon will be.|04-18-2014|pisces
135|No matter how difficult life may have been of late the Sun’s move into your birth sign tomorrow will cheer you up no end. Give some serious thought to what you want to be doing over the coming year because it could be one of the best ever.|04-19-2014|pisces
136|Now that the Sun is moving into your sign you should go with the flow and believe that the tide of events will wash you up on a shore that is to your liking. The message of the stars this week is to trust that the universe is infinitely kind.|04-20-2014|pisces
137|You will encounter more than one individual today who, to put it bluntly, you really can’t stand the sight of. The best way of dealing with such people is to pretend they don’t exist. Just make out they’re invisible and walk on by.|04-21-2014|pisces
138|Why is it always you who is expected to make the important decisions? Maybe because others know they can trust you. There will be a lot of upheavals over the coming 12 months but you will be a rock in the storm – and others will cling to you.|04-22-2014|pisces
139|Mercury joins the Sun in your sign today and suddenly your mood will be a whole lot better. The next three weeks or so are potentially the best of the year for you, so take full advantage of the opportunities that come your way.|04-23-2014|pisces
140|Your attitude to material things will change a lot over the coming year. People will count more with you than money and when you focus on family and friends you will find there are ways to be rich that trump everything else. It’s the true meaning of wealth.|04-24-2014|pisces
141|All things may be possible for you now but the planets warn you should be tying up loose ends rather than starting anything new. Are you prepared for what is to come? Get your act together, and keep your friends close.|04-25-2014|pisces
142|Not only will you succeed over the coming 12 months but you will succeed with style. The one thing that should – and does – matter to you more than anything is that, whatever job you agree to do, you do it better than anyone else. Be the best – always.|04-26-2014|pisces
143|The solar eclipse in your sign on Tuesday means this is a week full of potential. Whatever it is you have been planning now is the time to get serious about it. You will find reserves of energy and enthusiasm you never knew you had.|04-27-2014|pisces
144|Mars, planet of energy, will encourage you to be more assertive over the coming year, which is good, but you also need to plan carefully. If you just throw yourself at life with no rhyme or reason you won’t accomplish a fraction of what you are capable of.|04-28-2014|pisces
145|You feel like you can take on the world and win – and most likely you can. Today’s eclipse in your sign endows you with the confidence to try things that at others times might scare you. Remember to focus your energy in one direction at a time.|04-29-2014|pisces
146|Your way with words will open any door for you over the coming year. You know just what to say, and who to say it to, to get what you need. Move around as much as you can – the more you expand your horizons the more success you’ll enjoy.|04-30-2014|pisces
147|Make sure you know what is expected of you before backing a plan or project that will inevitably take up a lot of your time and energy. And make sure there’s a timetable too – you need to know when you will be free again.|05-01-2014|pisces
148|You may be tempted to slow down and take a break and you have certainly earned that right but the planets urge you to keep going a bit longer. Make the most of your energy surge while you can – you know how quickly things can change.|05-02-2014|pisces
149|You may be poised to start something new and exciting but if you are smart you will give it another day or two before making your move. Sunday’s Sun-Pluto link will most likely bring huge changes – the sort you can take advantage of.|05-03-2014|pisces
150|Try not to get too caught up in society and its problems this week or you may miss out on something of great value. Not all the answers you need are to be found out there in the world at large some come directly from the heart.|05-04-2014|pisces
151|Someone in a position of authority will look favorably on you over the next few days and if you are smart you will get something more out of it than just praise. Ask for a raise or a promotion – or both. Chances are they’ll say “yes”.|05-05-2014|pisces
152|The Sun’s link to Jupiter will give your confidence a much-needed boost today but you may still have to learn that in order to get some you also have to give some – you cannot realistically expect it to be all one way.|05-06-2014|pisces
153|You must be positive today. Both in your personal life and at work there is a lot at stake and you need to know what you want – and have the courage to reach out and take it. If you can do all that you will prosper, big time.|05-07-2014|pisces
154|You may be a bit hesitant and suspicious today but that’s okay. The thing to remember is that the cosmos is very much on your side at the moment, so you can afford to take a risk – or not, as you see fit.|05-08-2014|pisces
155|You may believe that if you don’t act soon your big chance will pass you by but it simply isn’t true. The sense of urgency you feel is an illusion and what happens over the next two or three days will prove it. There’s really no rush.|05-09-2014|pisces
156|You will be a force to be reckoned with over the next 48 hours. The Sun in your sign encourages you to come out of your shell and let the world see what a can-do Bull you can be. There is so much for you to accomplish.|05-10-2014|pisces
157|Venus, your ruler, and Mars, planet of energy, combine on your birthday, which is good, but at times they will pull you indifferent directions. There will be two main strands to your affairs this year and some how you have to find room for them both.|05-11-2014|pisces
158|Be true and honest and resist the temptation to cut corners merely because no one can stop you. This is a great time for friendships and group activities and it will be even better if you are all working together on the same ethical level.|05-12-2014|pisces
159|Focus only on those activities that make you happy over the next 12 months. Others will say you should be doing this and doing that but it is entirely up to you how you order your life. If you follow your dreams all your other needs will be taken care of.|05-13-2014|pisces
160|A full moon on your birthday is a reminder that your short-term goals and long-term goals must complement one another. Every step you take, no matter how small, should move you in the direction of your ultimate target. Don’t waste a day of your journey.|05-14-2014|pisces
161|There may be a clash of wills today but at least it will clear the air – and remind certain people that just because you’re a nice guy does not mean you are a pushover. This is still your time of year and so much is still possible.|05-15-2014|pisces
162|If you need to make changes, in either your personal life or your career, then make them without a second thought or a backward glance. Some people may think you are being needlessly ruthless but if you don’t change now it may never happen. Go for it!|05-16-2014|pisces
163|Your mind creates your reality. What you think about now is what you will find yourself doing later. Meditate on that idea and let it influence what you think, say and do over the coming 12 months. You want happiness and success? Then create them.|05-17-2014|pisces
164|Just because the Sun leaves your birth sign this week does not mean that your luck is about to turn for the worse. Plenty of good things will still come your way, only now you have to be a bit more sensible about how you use them.|05-18-2014|pisces
165|If everyone seems to be saying what you want to hear it is probably because that is their intention. Mercury is the planet of communication but also deception and its position today suggests you can’t really trust what you hear.|05-19-2014|pisces
166|You will have to deal with some pretty ruthless people over the coming 12 months and that means you will have to be ruthless yourself. Decide where you are going to draw the line and tell them what will happen if they step over it. And mean it!|05-20-2014|pisces
167|Make a name for yourself. Do something out of the ordinary. Start each day with a specific goal in mind and go all out to reach it. Also, remember that, both in your work and in your private life, excellence is what you do in the next five minutes.|05-21-2014|pisces
168|Your insight is such that others may wonder if you are psychic. Maybe you are, in a way, but there is nothing supernatural about your aims: you want to be a success and you want to be rich. Act on what your inner voice tells you.|05-22-2014|pisces
169|You need to come down to earth a bit and deal with matters of a practical nature. Above all you must be sensible with money, especially if you are the kind of Taurus who takes an “easy come, easy go” attitude to cash.|05-23-2014|pisces
170|You don’t know whether to push yourself harder or take things easy. If you feel the need to prove yourself by all means take on new responsibilities but make sure you get plenty of rest too. Don’t hammer yourself into the ground.|05-24-2014|pisces
171|There is no point worrying about a money matter because it is out of your hands. The approaching new moon suggests that it’s highly unlikely anything bad will happen, at least not to you. You might even come out ahead of the game.|05-25-2014|pisces
172|The moment you start seeing yourself as a victim is the moment when you lose. No matter what other people may be saying and doing you and you alone are master of your fate, so be positive and think like a winner again.|05-26-2014|pisces
173|You need to be a bit more serious about your cash flow situation. Tomorrow’s new moon will make it clear where and how savings need to be made – after that it’s up to you. No more shopping sprees for you – for now.|05-27-2014|pisces
174|You must hold out for what it is you know you deserve. The planets indicate it will be your rivals who blink first, so look tough, act tough and be tough in your approach to all kinds of negotiations, especially those involving money.|05-28-2014|pisces
175|You need to open up a bit and show your vulnerable side. Too often you give the impression that nothing can bring you down when, in reality, you are as sensitive as everyone else. Find a comfortable shoulder to cry on today.|05-29-2014|pisces
176|You are strongly advised not to make too many plans – you have enough on your plate as it is. If someone asks you to take on extra responsibilities you must turn them down flat. Your health could be at risk if you push yourself too hard.|05-30-2014|pisces
177|You are trying too hard to impress other people. Don’t worry what friends or work colleagues may think about you, just focus your time and energy on what you should be doing and the results will speak volumes about your ability.|05-31-2014|pisces
178|You will be rather assertive over the next few days, which is good. However, if you find yourself in a situation where you are able to make others do what they clearly don’t want to do you must back off. Their feelings are important too.|06-01-2014|pisces
179|Be careful when dealing with people today, especially if money is in some way involved. Anything that sounds too good to be true most likely is, so don’t let your enthusiasm – or your greed – get the better of you.|06-02-2014|pisces
180|Watch what you spend over the next 24 hours because if you go over the top you are sure to regret it. The planets warn you may not be as well off as you seem to believe. Watch out for those hidden costs.|06-03-2014|pisces
181|Sometimes the standards you set are impossible to reach and that seems to be the case at the moment. Current influences make you intensely ambitious but don’t forget you have limits like everyone else. Make sure you know what they are.|06-04-2014|pisces
182|Why are you trying to do everything the hard way? Is it because you think you have to prove yourself? Not only is it unnecessary but it could also be self-defeating. Be who you are, not who you think others want you to be.|06-05-2014|pisces
183|You will get the chance to move up in the world today but you need to act quickly. Uranus, planet of the unexpected, will bring sudden upheavals but even though they may seem a bit frightening they will work in your favor.|06-06-2014|pisces
184|Your routine will be disrupted in some way today and although you won’t like it you will have to adapt. Don’t bother complaining to people in positions of power because they don’t really care. Keep a low profile – it’s by far your best option.|06-07-2014|pisces
185|Because Taurus is one of the zodiac’s “fixed” signs you don’t like to admit, even to yourself, that you might ever be wrong. That could be a problem this week as the planets demand you be more flexible. Can you even spell the word?|06-08-2014|pisces
186|The more you try to convince people that you know what you are doing the more they disbelieve you – a most frustrating situation! Never mind. You don’t need their support to do what you know must be done. You’re tough enough to go it alone.|06-09-2014|pisces
187|The planets warn you will have to fight hard to get your way today. Alternatively, of course, you could decide the effort isn’t worth it and not fight at all. Let fate take its course. You don’t have to be in control all the time.|06-10-2014|pisces
188|You seem to have retreated into your shell a bit of late and in doing so have lost contact with a number of important people. Make it a priority today to look them up and let them know you still exist – and you still care.|06-11-2014|pisces
189|The planets warn you may do something so out of character today or tomorrow that even those who know you well will be shocked. Hopefully it won’t damage your reputation too much but it will certainly lead to some interesting gossip!|06-12-2014|pisces
190|You will be in an impulsive mood today and there is a danger you might fall out with someone you really should be on good terms with. There is no point starting a war of words just because you don’t care for the way they do business.|06-13-2014|pisces
191|A lot of your time of late seems to have been spent on issues that are not worth the effort and people you will never really get along with. As from today you must be more selective. What is of prime importance to you? Do only that.|06-14-2014|pisces
192|Try not to show that you are sensitive about what other people are saying about you. If they can see you are hurt it will encourage them to be even more negative. Give the impression that you could not care less about their opinions.|06-15-2014|pisces
193|Money matters of one sort or another will take up a lot of time today. It may all seem rather trivial to you but you must take it seriously. The more financial loose ends you can tie up now the more fun you can have later on.|06-16-2014|pisces
194|Why are some people so negative? It seems that the more ideas and suggestions you come up with the more reasons they find to reject them. Maybe you should take the hint and stop trying to win them round. Go it alone for a while.|06-17-2014|pisces
195|Even if you are the kind of Taurus who keeps your emotions under control you will be much more outgoing than usual today. There are so many good things going on in your life that you’ve got to stand up and tell the whole world.|06-18-2014|pisces
196|There is no point cursing fate if what happens today is not to your liking. In the long-term everything will come good, so be strong and never doubt that no matter what happens, be it “good” or be it “bad”, you will be stronger for it.|06-19-2014|pisces
197|You may be tempted to interfere in someone else’s personal situation but no good will come of it. The simple fact is you cannot do everything for everyone, so decide who is on your help list and let others learn from their own mistakes.|06-20-2014|pisces
198|There were times of late when you came close to cracking but you kept at it and managed to turn a bad situation in your favor. Now you are in a position to turn the tables and put the pressure on your rivals. Do it with a smile.|06-21-2014|pisces
199|Your way with words will aid you over the next few days but it could also work against you if you use it to deceive people into believing things you know to be untrue. It might help you in the short-term but over time you’ll lose out.|06-22-2014|pisces
200|Friends and relatives will do what you ask of them if you ask nicely. Also, if there is something you know they desire and you are in a position to get it for them then go for it. Bribery is not always a bad thing!|06-23-2014|pisces
201|If you are tired of playing second fiddle to someone of lesser talent then now is the time to do something about it. Let employers and other important people know what you can do. Part of the problem is you rarely push yourself forward.|06-24-2014|pisces
202|It annoys you when others drag their feet but there is no point losing your temper if a friend or loved one takes too much time over something today. Think of it as part of life’s rich tapestry – and do whatever it takes to hold in that scream.|06-25-2014|pisces
203|The world is a wonderful place and what happens over the next 48 hours will remind you just how much is possible if you have a positive outlook on life. Your can-do attitude will encourage others to be positive too.|06-26-2014|pisces
204|Short trips will be productive today, so don’t stay in one place for too long. The more you are on the move the more likely it is you will meet people who can be of some use to you socially or in your career.|06-27-2014|pisces
205|At some stage over the next 48 hours you will see or hear something that makes you look at the world in a radically different way. Your new way of thinking will answer many of the difficult questions you have been asking.|06-28-2014|pisces
206|You need to keep up the pressure on those who seek to deny you what it is you deserve. If you give them even the smallest of hints that you might give up they will go all out to deny you. Make a fuss – and hang in there.|06-29-2014|pisces
207|You need to get serious about your money situation. For too long now you have been content to take what you were given but as communications planet Mercury is about to move in your favor again you must ask for more. No, demand it!|06-30-2014|pisces
208|The more others protest about what you are doing the more you will do it. You’re stubborn like that. Just be careful that your abrasive attitude does not upset someone in a position of authority. Why make enemies of powerful people?|07-01-2014|pisces
209|Something good will come your way today – something you have earned entirely by your own efforts. Others may say you don’t deserve to be so fortunate but only because they now wish they had been as creative and as hard-working as you.|07-02-2014|pisces
210|There is no need to be quite so competitive. The planets indicate if you relax and let life come to you today the rewards will be greater than you imagined – and you won’t have wasted your time and your energy on senseless rivalries.|07-03-2014|pisces
211|You like to take the initiative and make things happen but today you will have to yield to the whims of those who do not share your sense of adventure. It may be frustrating but you can’t change it so don’t let it upset you.|07-04-2014|pisces
212|The more others insist that you conform to their standards the more you will insist on going your own way and doing your own thing. You will be even more stubborn than usual over the next 48 hours – and that’s very stubborn indeed!|07-05-2014|pisces
213|You may be annoyed that you lost out in some way but you have only yourself to blame. Others warned you not to go it alone but did you listen? Of course not. In future, try not to be so stubborn and recognize who is trying to help.|07-06-2014|pisces
214|Life may be a bit of a struggle at the moment but on the plus side you will learn something useful from it. You are here for a reason. Your life has meaning and purpose. So stop complaining and start living again.|07-07-2014|pisces
215|It is always important to get your timing right and the planets indicate that the right time for making your mark on the world is now. Don’t wait to be asked to show what you can do – elbow your way to the front and just do it.|07-08-2014|pisces
216|The grass often looks greener on the other side of the fence but the planets warn you should stay right where you are. If you are thinking of changing your job, or maybe even your entire career, you are advised to think again.|07-09-2014|pisces
217|You like things to be in their proper place but some people enjoy making a mess just to annoy you. You know who they are and you know better than to let them get under your skin. Stay out of their way today.|07-10-2014|pisces
218|If your frame of mind is negative now you will find it hard to be positive over the next few days. Try to avoid people whose attitude might bring you down. If they want to be miserable that’s fine but you don’t have to join them.|07-11-2014|pisces
219|News from a distant place may not be music to your ears but don’t overreact. Today’s full moon cuts across the communications angle of your chart, so if you say the wrong thing you may regret it. Keep your thoughts to yourself.|07-12-2014|pisces
220|By all means turn down a social invitation in order to spend more time with someone you are close to emotionally. According to the planets this person is feeling a bit neglected and it’s your responsibility to do something about it.|07-13-2014|pisces
221|Act quickly if someone in a position of power offers you something you desire. It’s okay to be cautious, at least to begin with, but if you leave it too long you could find the opportunity has been offered to someone else.|07-14-2014|pisces
222|The more others try to persuade you there is nothing to worry about the more you wonder what they are trying to hide. Maybe you are being suspicious for no reason but, on the other hand, the planets do suggest you need to be careful.|07-15-2014|pisces
223|You need to stand back from money matters and business issues and see your life from a wider perspective. There are many types of wealth and the most important of all is to be rich in knowledge – and love, of course.|07-16-2014|pisces
224|You are entitled to enjoy yourself and there is no reason at all why you should feel guilty just because some people have not been as lucky as you. Help others when you get the chance but make sure you get the best out of life too.|07-17-2014|pisces
225|Your task for the next 24 hours is to find a way to release all that pent-up energy that’s inside you in a way that does you good while not harming other people. Give it some thought, then do something physical.|07-18-2014|pisces
226|You seem to be reluctant to try something everybody else is raving about. Maybe you’re right, maybe your sixth sense is telling you to take care. Or maybe you are being too cautious. Ultimately, of course, only you can decide.|07-19-2014|pisces
227|If you want to earn other people’s respect you have to lead by example. That applies in all areas but especially on the home front where the planets indicate that loved ones are on the point of rebellion! Don’t be too assertive for your own good.|07-20-2014|pisces
228|This is an important time for career matters, especially if you are the kind of Taurus who wants to get on in the world. Being ambitious is not a sin and anyone who suggests that it might be is not to be trusted.|07-21-2014|pisces
229|It may seem as if the whole world is against you but nothing could be further from the truth. All that is happening is that the Sun’s move into one of the more sensitive areas of your chart makes youmore touchy than usual. Lighten up!|07-22-2014|pisces
230|If the stresses and strains of life are beginning to get to you just take an hour or two out of your busy schedule and sit somewhere quiet where you can refresh both your body and mind. You must always find time to relax.|07-23-2014|pisces
231|Someone close needs a confidence boost and you are the one who can give it to them. Say or do what you know will make them feel good about themselves – as a bonus it will help you feel good about yourself as well.|07-24-2014|pisces
232|Someone you like may say something hurtful about you today, but you must not let it get to you and you must not let your friendship suffer. There is no ill intent and you are probably being a bit too sensitive for your own good.|07-25-2014|pisces
233|Expect many changes over the next 48 hours, both those you are happy with and those you would avoid if you possibly could. Certain people may at times annoy you but don’t lose your temper – it’s simply not worth the effort.|07-26-2014|pisces
234|It won’t be long before you find your voice and let others know what it is you expect of them. It might be wise, however, not to say anything too outrageous, especially as Venus, your ruler, opposes power planet Pluto over the next few days.|07-27-2014|pisces
235|Today’s cosmic activity means you will need to spell everything out in plain and simple language. If you leave even the smallest of room for doubt then lines will get crossed and tempers will get frayed and that’s no good to anyone.|07-28-2014|pisces
236|If you want something enough you will find a way to get it. If you have the courage to take a risk when everyone around you is telling you to stick with what you know and trust you may hit the jackpot. Listen to your instincts – always.|07-29-2014|pisces
237|There is a danger that you will overreact to criticism and say or do something that comes back to haunt you. Both at home and at work you must think carefully before replying to what others say. Stay in control of your emotions.|07-30-2014|pisces
238|A colleague will let you down today and you won’t be too happy about it. But don’t let it bother you too much because you are capable of carrying on and making a success of a project on your own – and all the glory will be yours.|07-31-2014|pisces
239|If someone you don’t usually get along with makes an effort to be nice to you today you must make an effort to be nice to them in return. Just because you have different values does not mean you cannot get along, or even be friends.|08-01-2014|pisces
240|You may not be able to explain to others how you have reached a certain conclusion but deep down you know it is right. The planets indicate you won’t be in the least bit hesitant – you know what you want and you know how to get it.|08-02-2014|pisces
241|You want to do something useful with your life and Neptune, planet of generosity of spirit, will give you the opportunity this week. Don’t try to do it alone though: do it with people who share your ideals – and your big heart.|08-03-2014|pisces
242|Your logic circuits may seem a bit disconnected today and you will have to make an effort not to let little things annoy you. Strive to see the good in everyone you meet. It won’t always be easy but it’s there if you look for it.|08-04-2014|pisces
243|You have never been a slave to your desires, so why are you acting as if you have no choice in what you are expected to do? The fact is you always have a choice and to claim otherwise is simply not right. Take responsibility.|08-05-2014|pisces
244|Over the next few days you will have to strike a balance between the needs of your loved ones and the needs of employers and other important people. You CAN please them all but you need to be smart and plan carefully.|08-06-2014|pisces
245|You want to be active, and that’s good, but don’t expect others to be as motivated as you. Not everyone shares your passion for making things work and this may be one of those days when the only way to get things done is to do them yourself.|08-07-2014|pisces
246|Focus on other people’s needs today, because the planets will give you the chance to be of service to someone who does not share your strength of character. And, of course, what you do for others now will, one day, come back to you.|08-08-2014|pisces
247|It may seem as if the odds are stacked against you but the planets suggest you can easily break through any obstacles that have been placed in your path. Let everyone know you mean business. Few will dare take you on.|08-09-2014|pisces
248|Try not to jump to conclusions this week because most likely they will be wrong. Wait until the early part of next week before deciding if a friend really has let you down, because only then will you be able to see the situation clearly.|08-10-2014|pisces
249|You are not the kind who enjoys having your private life made public and at some stage today you will have to let someone know that their big mouth is not appreciated. They’ll get the message, if you say it with enough menace.|08-11-2014|pisces
250|By all means aim high, by all means set yourself targets, but don’t make them so far ahead of what you are capable of that failure is more likely than not. You don’t have to be perfect – you’re perfect just the way you are.|08-12-2014|pisces
251|If you find yourself torn between your loved ones and your busy work schedule today the best thing to do is to make a decision and stick to it. You can’t please everyone but if you don’t make a choice you won’t please anyone.|08-13-2014|pisces
252|Friends and loved ones have the upper hand at the moment and if you are smart you will accept that and not make a fuss. Also, it might not be wise to draw too much attention to yourself on the work front. Keep a low profile.|08-14-2014|pisces
253|The pace of life will pick up considerably today and over the weekend and if you are involved in anything of a creative nature it will go extremely well for you. Make sure the powers that be are aware of what you can do.|08-15-2014|pisces
254|There will be times this weekend when doubts creep in and you do not feel as self-assured as you look. Developments on the work front may be especially unsettling but there is no need to worry – it will work out for the best in the end.|08-16-2014|pisces
255|If you fell out with a friend or work colleague recently you should be thinking of ways you can make up with them. That may not be possible until later in the week but you can set the scene now – by not being so touchy!|08-17-2014|pisces
256|By all means splash out and buy yourself something that makes you feel good. Okay, so maybe you will regret it later when your credit card bill is due but you need something to cheer you up right now. Go for it.|08-18-2014|pisces
257|You are being pulled between two extremes, making it difficult for you to make up your mind about the best course of action. Do you take a chance or do you play safe? Only you can decide, but you must make it quick.|08-19-2014|pisces
258|You need to give others the impression that you are not the sort who can be easily manipulated. Act tough today, even if you don’t feel tough inside, because the first impression you give others is the impression that will last.|08-20-2014|pisces
259|Over the past few weeks cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart has made it hard to be positive, but that will change on Saturday when the Sun moves in your favor. Suddenly life will be worth living again. |08-21-2014|pisces
260|An unpleasant issue will have to be dealt with today. You can avoid it no longer. Of course, if you had sorted it out when the situation first arose several months ago you would not be in this position now. Never mind, get busy.|08-22-2014|pisces
261|The Sun’s change of signs this weekend marks the start of the most dynamic time of the year, for you at least. Forget about your troubles and think only of the fun times you are going to have. There will be too many of them to count.|08-23-2014|pisces
262|Cosmic activity in the most dynamic area of your chart will inspire you to think and act in adventurous new ways over the next few days. In fact it is no exaggeration to say it will in some way or other transform your existence.|08-24-2014|pisces
263|You were born with some remarkable talents but have you been making the most of them? If you are honest you will admit you could have done more but that’s okay because you will always get another chance and here comes one now!|08-26-2014|pisces
264|Don’t complain that certain people seem to be making life difficult for you because, even if it is true, it will be to your advantage. Sometimes in life it is necessary to take a small step back before you can take a huge leap forward.|08-27-2014|pisces
265|Be on your guard today, especially when dealing with money matters. There is a danger that someone will try to cheat you, and if your mind is elsewhere they may even succeed. Trust is not something you should give easily now.|08-28-2014|pisces
266|If you expect great things of yourself then you will accomplish great things. But make sure it is your own expectations you are trying to live up to – not other people’s. Friends and family will never know you as well as you know yourself.|08-29-2014|pisces
267|It may seem as if someone is being rude for no good reason, and maybe they are, but don’t let it get to you. Move your attention away from their negativity and highlight instead the positive plans you have made. Focus on your dream.|08-30-2014|pisces
268|Be alert to new possibilities. You may be happy with your life but there is always something you can do to make it even better and you will know without a shadow of a doubt what that something is this week. Don’t get stuck in a rut. |08-31-2014|pisces
269|You seem to be worrying about the few little things that are going wrong in your life and ignoring all the big things that are going right. Raise your sights and see the wider cosmic picture. Life is good and getting better by the minute.|09-01-2014|pisces
270|Money matters will go very well indeed today as will anything to do with your working routine. It seems that Lady Luck is very much on your side at the moment and if you are smart you will make good use of her.|09-02-2014|pisces
271|This is one of the best times of the year for getting things done, but the things you do must not be of a minor nature. Make use of today’s Sun-Pluto contact to aim higher than usual. Look to the sky, then shoot for the stars.|09-03-2014|pisces
272|If there is something you have always wanted to do but never quite got around to starting, don’t worry – you are about to get another chance. This is the ideal time to begin something of a creative nature, so get serious about it.|09-04-2014|pisces
273|The next few weeks will be special for you, and for those who are special to you. Even people you think of as rivals or enemies will be more amenable than usual. So if you need to ask favors now is the time to make your play.|09-05-2014|pisces
274|The harder you try to bring a little happiness into someone’s life the more determined they are to be sad. Take the hint and leave them alone. Some people enjoy wallowing in despair, so leave them to it until they’re ready to smile again.|09-06-2014|pisces
275|You should by now have a clear idea of what it is you are hoping to accomplish, and because there are no more doubts in your mind you will be able to take decisive action at last. Act for others too when you can.|09-07-2014|pisces
276|According to the planets you are unusually in tune with the spirit of the age – for the next 24 hours at least – so don’t be surprised if strangers approach you and treat you as if you are someone special. Because you are.|09-08-2014|pisces
277|If a dispute over a career or family matter seems to be dragging on, now is the time to settle your differences. The full moon means it’s not a case of one side winning and the other side losing – either you both win or you both lose.|09-09-2014|pisces
278|A new person on your social scene will get your attention and you may even be thinking in terms of romance, but the planets warn the relationship is unlikely to last. Keep it low key and light-hearted and you’ll both have a lot of fun.|09-10-2014|pisces
279|Whatever difficulties you face at this moment don’t try to blame other people for them. The more you deny that you are responsible the worse things are likely to get. Next time around, don’t forget that causes always have consequences.|09-11-2014|pisces
280|You must be true to your principles today. A rival may appear to have an advantage because they are prepared to use dishonest methods but over time their tactics will rebound on them, leaving you with a clear run to success.|09-12-2014|pisces
281|A serious attempt to cut back on your spending now will save you a great deal of trouble later on. Do you really need all those things you’ve been buying? Of course not. Get your financial house in order over the next 48 hours.|09-13-2014|pisces
282|It may feel like you are losing something that is precious to you but when you realize what the future has in store – as you will do any day now – your hankering after what you lost will soon be forgotten. The future is where it’s at.|09-14-2014|pisces
283|Something you say may seem obvious to you but other people may struggle to understand what you are talking about. Try to see things from their point of view, then explain what’s going on in plain and simple language.|09-15-2014|pisces
284|An opportunity to improve a partnership or relationship could easily be missed. Focus on it to the exclusion of everything else. Career issues and money matters may seem important but in the greater scheme of things they don’t count for much.|09-16-2014|pisces
285|The Sun in Virgo endows you not only with a positive outlook but also a willingness to take risks. Something you begin over the next few days could change your life in remarkable ways, so stop dithering and start living the dream.|09-17-2014|pisces
286|Avoid anything too adventurous today, especially if it is packaged in an appealing way. Stick with what feels right to you, even if others say it is boring. You know what you like and there is no logical reason why you should change it.|09-18-2014|pisces
287|It does not matter what threats you make today a work colleague will move at their own speed – and that’s dead slow! Don’t bother losing your temper as it will just encourage them to dig in their heels even more. Grit your teeth and bear it.|09-19-2014|pisces
288|You are enjoying life at the moment but you sense that you will soon have to turn your mind to more serious matters. Pay more attention to your health this weekend. It may be time for a new diet or fitness regime.|09-20-2014|pisces
289|You know what you want and you know how to get it but don’t push too hard. Your confidence may be high at the moment but confidence alone may not be enough. The planets warn it will pay you to take things slowly for a day or two.|09-21-2014|pisces
290|Be careful you don’t offend people by making a joke about things they take very seriously. Yes, of course, the world would be a better place if everyone could laugh at misfortune, especially their own, but it isn’t going to happen.|09-22-2014|pisces
291|A testing phase is about to begin but you can make things easier for yourself by being a little less intense in both your attitude and your actions. Your workload will increase but don’t be tempted to burn the candle at both ends.|09-23-2014|pisces
292|You may have a natural grasp of how something works but a friend or family member just isn’t getting it and it’s up to you to help them out. Don’t get impatient, just explain it to them in simple language – several times if needs be.|09-24-2014|pisces
293|No doubt there is a rational explanation for everything that ever happens but sometimes things happen that make you wonder if there is not more going on. Keep your mind open to new and strange possibilities over the next 24 hours.|09-25-2014|pisces
294|Something will happen over the next few days that undermines your confidence, and it takes a lot to make a Taurus start questioning themselves. Be that as it may everything will be resolved when Venus, your ruler, changes signs next week.|09-26-2014|pisces
295|A dispute that has dragged on far too long must be resolved this weekend. Make an effort to see the other person’s side of the story as well as your own. The fact is that neither of you is either wholly right or wholly wrong.|09-27-2014|pisces
296|The lesson of the stars for the coming week is that you must learn to be grateful for what you have got. Something you have always taken for granted is about to be challenged and it will make you realize just how lucky you are. |09-28-2014|pisces
297|If a friend or work colleague tries to turn each and every chat you have into a conversation about them you must let them know it’s getting a bit boring. It’s not about “them” or “me” – it’s about “us”. Or at least it should be.|09-29-2014|pisces
298|Make an effort to tackle routine matters today, Yes, of course, they are boring but if you don’t get them out of the way now they will continue to nag at you. You may also learn something you can turn to your financial advantage.|09-30-2014|pisces
299|You seem to be in one of your silly moods – and that’s a good thing. Most days you might worry what others think of your behavior but today you just cannot be bothered. If more conservative types are offended that’s too bad.|10-01-2014|pisces
300|Don’t wait for permission to do something you instinctively know is right. Even the most agreeable Taurus should be more assertive when there is a higher good at work. And remember: the best way to get something done is to do it yourself.|10-02-2014|pisces
301|There may be many things in your life that you could change for the better but is it worth it if, in doing so, you have to change habits and routines you feel comfortable with? Only you can decide, but you need to decide quickly.|10-03-2014|pisces
302|If you are satisfied with an agreement of some kind then it does not matter what other people think about it. Yes, maybe you could negotiate a better deal if you were a bit tougher, but if you’re happy the universe is happy too.|10-04-2014|pisces
303|Whether or not you have a hard time of things this week depends not on your circumstances but on your state of mind. A lunar eclipse in the most sensitive area of your chart urges you to look on the bright side – always.|10-05-2014|pisces
304|According to the planets you have reached the end of one particular road and what happens in the run-up to Wednesday’s eclipse will point you in a new direction. After that it’s up to you. What’s holding you back? Absolutely nothing.|10-06-2014|pisces
305|What happens in your working environment over the next few days will give you the chance to show how much you have learned and how well suited you are to take on a leadership position. While others lose their heads you will be the picture of calm.|10-07-2014|pisces
306|Treat yourself today – do something for no other reason than it makes you feel good. Some people may be shocked by your extravagant behavior but that will only add to your enjoyment. How far do you take it? As far as you like!|10-08-2014|pisces
307|A business or financial venture may seem straightforward but as Mercury is in one of its retrograde phases there may be hidden pitfalls. For that reason alone you are advised not to commit yourself unless you have a get-out clause – in writing.|10-09-2014|pisces
308|You must be decisive today, especially on the work front where the right word in the right ear at the right time could open doors that have been closed for too long. Don’t hesitate: the moment an opportunity arises you must seize it.|10-10-2014|pisces
309|If you pretend to be something or someone you are not over the next 48 hours you are sure to be found out, and the results could be embarrassing. The personality you were born with cannot be changed but it can be improved – so embrace it.|10-11-2014|pisces
310|If your desire is strong enough and if your motives are pure enough you will attract into your life precisely what you need this week. You are sending out powerful signals to the universe and the universe will be delighted to grant you your wish.|10-12-2014|pisces
311|The more you worry about something the worse it will get. But the opposite is also true: the more you look on the bright side and believe everything will come right the better it will get. Your reality reflects what goes on in your mind.|10-13-2014|pisces
312|A number of serious matters will have to be dealt with later in the week but today you can relax and enjoy the good things in life. Venus, your ruler, linked to Jupiter means you will find fun wherever you are and whatever you do.|10-14-2014|pisces
313|The planets are very much on your side at the moment but for best results you should not wait for things to happen, you should make things happen yourself. If you make twice as much effort today you will get four times as much back.|10-15-2014|pisces
314|At some stage today it will be painfully clear that you have been moving in the wrong direction, and that means you must change course immediately. Ignoring the evidence will only compound the error and make things even worse than before.|10-16-2014|pisces
315|It’s nice to know that your efforts are appreciated and Saturn in your opposite sign is about to bring you some kind of reward or recognition. It may not be anything out of the ordinary but it will give a huge boost to your confidence.|10-17-2014|pisces
316|Don’t be too harsh on yourself if you say something that rubs others up the wrong way. Yes, of course, it would have been nice if you had given it a bit more thought before opening your mouth but no one’s perfect, not even you! |10-19-2014|pisces
317|There may be many things that interest you but there is only one thing that demands your attention. A serious matter needs to be dealt with today and, if you deal with it quickly and efficiently, you can then move on to something more exciting.|10-20-2014|pisces
318|The approaching eclipse marks either a turning point or a point of no return. Which it is depends a great deal on your attitude. Treat what goes out of your life over the next few days as surplus to requirements – you really no longer need it.|10-21-2014|pisces
319|A little voice in the back of your head is telling you to get tough with someone who has taken one too many liberties in recent weeks. If you don’t they will take an even bigger liberty tomorrow or the day after, and the results could be ugly.|10-22-2014|pisces
320|As both the Sun and Venus, your ruler, move into the partnership area of your chart today it will pay you to be more open about your feelings. Not too much though – others don’t want to know everything – just that they mean something to you.|10-23-2014|pisces
321|It may seem like a partnership of some sort has reached a point where it can no longer do anything for you but you are wrong. What happens today will make you realize you have been taking it for granted – and it still has much to offer.|10-24-2014|pisces
322|What takes place this weekend may not be entirely to your liking but if you make a point of viewing new experiences as opportunities rather than as setbacks this can still be a positive phase. Expect the best and you will get the best.|10-25-2014|pisces
323|There is only so much you can do for someone you love – at some point you have to let them get on with it and learn from their own mistakes. If they take a fall then so be it – all you can do is be there to help them up again.|10-26-2014|pisces
324|Avoid complicated solutions. The problem you will be faced with over the next two or three days is really quite simple, which means the answer must be simple too. Focus on the basics and don’t read into it what isn’t there at all.|10-27-2014|pisces
325|Don’t get so absorbed in a work or social issue that you miss the signals a loved one is sending you. They need your attention and, what is more, they have a right to it. Mundane matters can wait – relationships cannot.|10-29-2014|pisces
326|If someone reacts in an emotional way to what you say today then perhaps you should take the hint and steer clear of touchy issues. They will have to face up to reality sooner or later, of course, but now is not the right time.|10-30-2014|pisces
327|You may be eager to know what is going on but the planets suggest it’s unlikely that family and friends will confide in you. Stay calm and don’t let them see how desperate you are — that will make them even more secretive.|11-02-2014|pisces
328|What happens today may not by itself seem of any great significance but with the benefit of hindsight you will see it plays a big part in the grand scheme of things. Never doubt you are on the road to somewhere good. |11-03-2014|pisces
329|A touch of realism is needed today, both on a creative level and in affairs of the heart. You don’t want to be unkind, of course, but you realize it is better to be blunt than misunderstood. Loved ones will one day thank you for your honesty.|11-04-2014|pisces
330|The more time and effort you pour into a certain situation the worse it appears to get. Why not take the hint and back off a bit? You will enjoy life more if you stop worrying about things over which you have no control. |11-05-2014|pisces
331|It would be a mistake to place your faith in what other people believe rather than what your instincts tell you is true. Have the courage of your convictions and do only what feels right to you. You don’t need anyone to hold your hand.|11-06-2014|pisces
332|You may be tempted to put pressure on a partner or loved one do something for you but according to the planets it isn’t necessary. Even if they do not agree with your aims they will, out of a sense of duty, help if they can. Just ask nicely.|11-07-2014|pisces
333|If a friend or relative wants to make a decision for you, let them. You should find it easier to trust other people’s judgment now that Mercury is moving into your opposite sign of Scorpio. Yes, they have your interests at heart.|11-08-2014|pisces
334|What starts out as good news first thing this week may look like bad news later in the week but try not to get worked up about it. Things change and all you can do is change with them. What changes later in the week will delight you.|11-09-2014|pisces
335|Be honest about what you think today, even if your point of view is likely to offend certain people. You are as entitled to your opinion as they are to theirs, so speak up and make sure you get your message across. It’s a message worth hearing.|11-10-2014|pisces
336|Be clear about what you believe and be positive when communicating those beliefs to other people. You will find that all sorts of people are interested in what you have to say, but listen as well, because learning is a two-way process. |11-11-2014|pisces
337|The pressure is beginning to mount and you feel there are things in your life which need to be changed, and you are right. The fact is if you cannot change them yourself, fate will change them for you. Maybe you should let it.|11-12-2014|pisces
338|Your powers of self-discipline will be tested over the next 24 hours – and you will pass the test with flying colors. However, a harder test is on its way, so don’t think you have done all you have to. Be vigilant.|11-13-2014|pisces
339|You need something to take your mind off your problems. Better still, you need to reorder your mind so you can see they are not really problems at all. Treat life as a game and make sure you have fun – then you’ll be a winner too.|11-14-2014|pisces
340|You will have to be strict with yourself this weekend if you are to finish all the tasks you have set yourself. Start immediately and don’t stop until everything is done. The longer you put it off, the harder it will be. |11-15-2014|pisces
341|There is nothing you cannot handle and nothing you cannot do if you believe in yourself. It may seem as if others have more talent and experience than you but it’s simply not true. Act as if you cannot fail, and you won’t.|11-16-2014|pisces
342|Loved ones, colleagues and people in positions of authority hold you in high regard because you are an individual – you refuse to be like everyone else. Emphasize your uniqueness today and you will find your natural place – at the top.|11-18-2014|pisces
343|If you feel the urge to travel today don’t let work hold you back. There will be no end of opportunities to complete outstanding tasks over the next few days, so forget about your daily schedule and have fun. You need a break from routine.|11-19-2014|pisces
344|Concentrate on what you are good at and ignore everything else. You may find that difficult to do as the planets seem determined to disrupt your routine but few signs are as focused as you once you decide what it is you desire.|11-20-2014|pisces
345|What someone tells you today may seem confusing and contradictory but if you think about it a bit you will get the message. Some people find it difficult to say things in a straightforward manner, so get out your pocket translator. |11-21-2014|pisces
346|If life is what happens to us while we are busy making other plans then what happens this weekend may come as a bit of a shock. The plans you made may not work out the way you expected, but events could still move in your favor.  |11-22-2014|pisces
347|There will be times over the coming week when you wonder why you have been singled out for so much good fortune. Do you really deserve it? Yes you do, in fact no one deserves it more. Stop putting yourself down for no reason.|11-23-2014|pisces
348|A plan to boost your earning power may be tempting but if it means doing something that leaves you feeling uncomfortable with yourself then maybe you should give it a miss. Like love, self-respect is something that money can’t buy. |11-24-2014|pisces
349|Ideas and insights are coming thick and fast but because Taurus is such a down-to-earth sign you may be reluctant to act on a hunch or a whim. But you must. The ideas and insights of today are the realities of tomorrow. |11-25-2014|pisces
350|If you come in for criticism today – and with Saturn strong in your opposite sign that is almost guaranteed – don’t react as if the world is coming to an end. There may in fact be some truth in what others are saying about you.|11-26-2014|pisces
351|No matter how many times you may have doubted your instincts in the past, don’t doubt them today. According to the planets you are in tune with the spirit of the times – and it’s about time you made it pay!|11-27-2014|pisces
352|If you try to please everyone this weekend you will end up pleasing no one, so do what feels right to you and live with the consequences. Your can-do attitude will impress others, which is nice, but you don’t have to be popular to be successful.|11-29-2014|pisces
353|Something you thought you knew all about will work out in a completely unexpected way and something you are completely in the dark about will suddenly seem so familiar. So don’t jump to conclusions – they will probably be wrong.|11-30-2014|pisces
354|The task you have to tackle over the next few days may not seem too inspiring but once you get to grips with it you will find it engages your interest more than you imagined. Who knows, you may even grow to like it! |12-01-2014|pisces
355|You cannot possibly be on good terms with everyone all of the time – even a good-natured Taurus will fall out with friends and loved ones once in a while. But it’s no big deal, so don’t beat yourself up today if harsh words are spoken. |12-02-2014|pisces
356|If someone has been taking advantage of your good nature then you must cut them out of your life. They will see you are serious and will come back with their tail between their legs begging for forgiveness. Whether you grant it is up to you.|12-03-2014|pisces
357|Do you focus on what others expect you to do, or do you focus on what you want to do? Only you can decide but you must choose one or the other – if you try to get the best of both worlds you may end up with neither.|12-04-2014|pisces
358|It will occur to you over the next 24 hours that you have been taking the wrong things seriously. Something you have been working so hard towards is most likely not worth the effort, but that’s okay – once you accept that you can make other plans.|12-05-2014|pisces
359|According to the planets you have reached the low point of your current emotional cycle and from here on things will get noticeably easier. Today’s full moon will encourage you to see your glass as half full rather than half empty.|12-06-2014|pisces
360|Don’t give yourself such a hard time over the next few days – make life easy for yourself by refusing to get worked up about trivial matters. Be warned: interfering with the natural course of events could have unnatural consequences!|12-07-2014|pisces
361|An embarrassing event will make you a bit sheepish about showing your face in certain circles but so what if you made a fool of yourself? No one is perfect, not even a Taurus, so laugh about your mistake – and others will laugh with you. |12-08-2014|pisces
362|Refuse to settle for second best in anything you do. The standards you set now are the standards you will have to live by for the next few months, so aim high, be first and don’t let anyone come between you and success. |12-09-2014|pisces
363|The restrictions you have been laboring under in recent days will fade over the next 24 hours. Your attitude will be more positive too, giving you a greater sense of freedom and making it much easier to take control of your own destiny. |12-10-2014|pisces
364|If you want to get ahead in the world then you are going to have to be a bit less thin-skinned. The kind of people who can make things happen for you are not the kind of people who worry about whose egos they might bruise, so toughen up.|12-12-2014|pisces
365|If you feel the need to apologize for something you did that was wrong now is the time. And if someone apologizes to you for something they should not have done be gracious and tell them it really doesn’t matter.|12-13-2014|pisces
366|You must not skirt around the main issue over the next few days. Work colleagues and loved ones alike will be more impressed if you tell the truth, even if what you have to say is not what they want to hear.|12-14-2014|pisces
367|You won’t find it difficult to get your own way today but don’t go too far and give others the impression that you think you are better than them. Most likely you are but you know how touchy some people get, so be subtle.|12-15-2014|pisces
368|The next 24 hours will be hectic to say the least. If you find yourself rushing all over the place but not actually getting much done maybe you should take that as a sign that you have lost control of the situation. Slow down a bit. |12-16-2014|pisces
369|Try not to be too open about what you think today or you may let slip something that could be used against you by your rivals. Your plans are your plans alone – you don’t have to broadcast them to the entire world.|12-17-2014|pisces
370|Go with the flow, even though you may not be able to see where it is taking you. What happens over the next few days may be unsettling but the planets promise you will do very well out of the changes that take place. |12-18-2014|pisces
371|You will help those who need it today but there is a danger that you will rescue someone who not only does not deserve it but will expect you to help them out every time they get in trouble. You may have to be cruel to be kind.|12-19-2014|pisces
372|As the Sun moves into one of the most outgoing and optimistic areas of your chart this weekend you can expect a lot of remarkable things to happen. If you feel you would be happier in a different environment, just get up and go.|12-20-2014|pisces
373|A more laid-back approach will work wonders this week. Certain issues may seem important to you now but what will they mean ten or twenty years down the line? Not a lot. Keep things in perspective – and remember to smile.|12-21-2014|pisces
374|You like surprises and that’s just as well because they will be arriving every few minutes over the next couple of days. Be adventurous. Be outrageous. Be the one who makes things happen. Today is the first day of the rest of your life.|12-22-2014|pisces
375|Your lust for life is amazing but try not to scatter your energy in too many directions over the next two or three days because it’s unlikely you will be able to maintain the pace for long. Focus on the one thing that matters most to you. |12-23-2014|pisces
376|A colleague will make you the kind of offer you find hard to refuse today, but can you trust them? Do what you can to find out if it is genuine and, if it is, let them know quickly that you want in on the game. |12-24-2014|pisces
377|Spend time with the people you love today. Even if you have different ideas of what makes the perfect social occasion you will still enjoy each other’s company. You may even hear some juicy gossip that you were unaware of before. |12-25-2014|pisces
378|Try not to waste money on things you do not need. It may not bother you now but looking back in a few weeks time you may regret having been so free and easy with your cash. It doesn’t grow on trees you know. |12-26-2014|pisces
379|If you need assistance with something over the next 48 hours you must ask for it. Cosmic activity in your fellow Earth sign of Capricorn encourages you to be dynamic but that does not mean you have to do things alone. |12-27-2014|pisces
380|Your beliefs are likely to change a lot over the next few weeks and soon you will be looking at life from a different angle. Things you never noticed before will suddenly come into focus and the picture you get may surprise you.|12-28-2014|pisces
381|You will have to deal with someone’s negative or emotional attitude over the next 24 hours – while making sure you don’t get negative or emotional yourself. This is one of the best times of the year for you, so don’t let anyone spoil it.|12-29-2014|pisces
382|Taurus people tend to be lucky with cash and investments and if you don’t quite believe that now you will believe it by the end of the week. If you get the chance, go into partnership with someone who complements your style. |12-30-2014|pisces
383|By all means share your dreams with other people but don’t expect much support. Whatever you say they will find ways to pick holes in it, which won’t do your confidence much good. Dream on but keep your dreams to yourself. |12-31-2014|pisces
384|Anyone who doubts you have what it takes to succeed will doubt no longer as you go all out to get the new year started in spectacular fashion. Whatever your job or career may be you want that top spot – and you are going to get it. |01-01-2015|pisces
385|If you feel the need to get up and go somewhere different today then do so. Because the approaching full moon takes place in that area of your chart associated with travel your journey is sure to be exciting – and could be educational too. |01-02-2015|pisces
386|Venus moves into the career area of your chart today, which means you will get ahead quicker if you treat life as something to be enjoyed rather than as a constant battle. If you’re not smiling then you’re not doing it right. |01-03-2015|pisces
387|Don’t make too many changes over the next two or three days because you will probably have to change them back again towards the end of the week. It’s not like you to be impulsive, so why start now? |01-04-2015|pisces
388|You don’t have to apologize for something you said that rubbed a friend or relative up the wrong way. It works both ways: they’ve said plenty of things that annoyed you over the years which you chose not to make an issue of. |01-05-2015|pisces
389|No matter how big your problems may seem to you now, in the greater scheme of things they are of little importance, so stop worrying and start smiling again. If you can afford the time and money this is a good time to take a vacation. |01-06-2015|pisces
390|A colleague you thought you could rely on will say something today that makes you realize they are not on your side after all. End the association if you think that’s the right thing to do – and next time don’t be so gullible. |01-07-2015|pisces
391|Neptune, planet of deception, warns you need to treat what you hear today with the utmost suspicion. That may sound rather negative but according to the planets someone is trying to put ideas in your head that do not belong there.|01-08-2015|pisces
392|You will be dealing with important people today, the kind of people who can make things happen. The trick is to get them to make things happen for you. If you get the chance to impress them, take it. There’s no point being shy. |01-09-2015|pisces
393|Don’t let anyone take decisions for you this weekend because most likely they will get them wrong and leave you to clear up the mess. If a matter is important to you then you should be prepared to be decisive about it.|01-10-2015|pisces
394|There are some rather wild ideas flying around at the moment, the kind of ideas that could cause trouble if you are foolish enough to act on them. Keep a clear head and keep away from people who are too easily carried away.|01-11-2015|pisces
395|This is a great day for meeting with friends and engaging in activities that make you glad to be alive. On the career front, your ambitions may seem lofty to some but you know that anything is possible if you want it enough – and you do. |01-12-2015|pisces
396|You will notice someone today who for some reason you never noticed before. Which only goes to show how easy it is to miss things, and people, unless you are actually looking for them. What other things have you overlooked? |01-13-2015|pisces
397|There are a lot of people out there who could benefit from your brand of kindness, so start looking for ways you can assist them. Charity work would be especially rewarding – it would thrill you to see your efforts help those in need. |01-14-2015|pisces
398|Don’t worry too much if you fall out with a friend today because it’s really no big deal. It could even be beneficial in that you may need to clear the air and this is as good a time as any. Tomorrow you’ll be best buddies again.|01-15-2015|pisces
399|No matter what sad tales you hear from other people today you will be on a high. As far as you are concerned the world is, was and always will be a wonderful place. Hold on to that feeling as long as you can. |01-16-2015|pisces
400|What happens over the next 48 hours will in some way change your life. But will it change it for the better or for the worse? That depends on your goals. If you get the choice between making money and helping someone, do the latter. |01-17-2015|pisces
401|If you are under pressure now it can only be because you are putting yourself under pressure. Your ambitions will rise dramatically over the next few days but don’t expect too much of yourself too soon – take it a step at a time. |01-18-2015|pisces
402|You will either impress some very important people today or you will upset some very important people – there is no middle ground. This is a hugely important time for your career and reputation, so get noticed for the right reasons. |01-19-2015|pisces
403|If you find yourself under pressure today it can only be because you are putting yourself under pressure. You may be intensely ambitious but don’t expect too much too soon. A step at a time will get you where you need to go. |01-20-2015|pisces
404|You may find it hard getting through to a friend or a family member today but it’s no big deal so don’t worry about it. Chances are they don’t want to hear what you have to say, at least not at the moment, so don’t press it. |01-21-2015|pisces
405|You may think that a friend is holding out on you in some way, and maybe they are, but is it important? Pretend you have not noticed and let them get away with it. If a small victory makes them happy, let them have it.|01-22-2015|pisces
406|You will get along with people in positions of authority remarkably well today and if you need a favor then now is the time to ask. But don’t let it go to your head – yes, it is possible to ask for too much.|01-23-2015|pisces
407|You will have to deal with someone today who, to put it mildly, rubs you up the wrong way. Be that as it may they have something which you need, so be nice to them, at least until you’ve got what you want! |01-24-2015|pisces
408|A business matter may cause you some anxiety over the next few days but the planets indicate it’s not worth getting too excited about. Venus, your ruler, moves in your favor on Tuesday, and you may be on the move as well. |01-25-2015|pisces
409|Be careful what you say today because if you leave any doubt about your meaning someone could take your words the wrong way and cause a scene. Polish up your communication skills – you will need them on the work front. |01-26-2015|pisces
410|You may have to do something that does not go down well with loved ones today but you know it must be done and will ignore any criticism that comes your way. Sometimes your stubborn streak can be hugely beneficial!|01-27-2015|pisces
411|Don’t let a friendship suffer over a money issue that is of no real importance. It may seem a big deal to you now but in a matter of days you will realize it wasn’t worth the time or the energy you invested in it. |01-28-2015|pisces
412|Stand up for what you believe in and refuse to change your ways or your views simply to please those in positions of authority. Freedom of speech is a right well worth fighting for, so by all means pick a battle today. |01-29-2015|pisces
413|The planets are urging you to be open and friendly and show the world you have nothing to hide – even if you actually have plenty to hide! Pretend you don’t have a care in the world and others will be taken in by your act. |01-30-2015|pisces
414|You have been a bit free and easy with your spending in recent weeks and now would be a good time to cut back and, ideally, find some new sources of income. Don’t wait until you are forced to act – act now. |01-31-2015|pisces
415|You will get the chance to make friends with someone in a position of power this week. But don’t think you have to flatter them and agree with every word they say. What they like most about you is that you speak your mind. |02-01-2015|pisces
416|You must put your own needs first over the next few days, not for selfish reasons but because if you don’t you will lose out to people who are not as talented or deserving of success as you. Be bold and be the best.|02-02-2015|pisces
417|You need to get rid of all that emotional junk that is clogging up your life. Be ruthless with yourself – if you let your heart continue to rule your head you won’t get rid of half as much stuff as you should.|02-03-2015|pisces
418|You will take risks purely for the fun of it today, not really caring if you win or lose. The good news is you will win nine times out of ten, and on the one occasion when you do lose it will only be a minor setback. |02-04-2015|pisces
419|You must tell the truth today, even if it hurts the feelings of people you love. It will hurt them a lot more in the long-term if they discover they were the only ones who did not know what was going on. |02-05-2015|pisces
420|It might not be a good idea to speak from the heart over the next 24 hours, not with some of the negative opinions you have about certain people. A day or two from now your attitude will be a lot more positive. |02-06-2015|pisces
421|You will be in a party mood over the next 48 hours. You certainly won’t be too serious about life. People who say you should be working and making money are the kind of people you need most to avoid.|02-07-2015|pisces
422|If you are the kind of Taurus who prefers to stay out of the limelight the next few days could be a bit uncomfortable. Like it or not you are going to be in the spotlight, so maybe you should learn to enjoy the attention.|02-08-2015|pisces
423|The people you will have to deal with today respect facts and figures, so show them your plans and let them know how you can make them work. If they think you know what you are talking about they will support you to the hilt. |02-09-2015|pisces
424|You have set your heart on doing something and you intend to see it through to the end, no matter what the critics might say. You know what you want and you know how to get it, so what are you waiting for? |02-10-2015|pisces
425|Others will go out of their way to keep you quiet today, because the truth is not what they want to hear. If you find yourself at odds with people in positions of power, don’t back down. Your have right on your side. |02-11-2015|pisces
426|Don’t be discouraged if today’s events throw your plans into disarray. One way or another most people around you will be dealing with chaos and confusion over the next 24 hours, so you won’t stand out from the crowd. |02-12-2015|pisces
427|You will see or hear something to your advantage over the next 24 hours, something that can have a positive effect on your career. What that something may be is impossible to say but you will know it when you see it.|02-13-2015|pisces
428|Most of the time you are a really tough negotiator but today and tomorrow you will go right the other way and let someone have for free what would usually cost them a great deal of money. It’s a one off, of course.|02-14-2015|pisces
429|You may have high ideals but do you live up to them? That is the question you will be asking yourself over the next few days and being the honest sort you will have to admit that sometimes you don’t. But you will in future! |02-15-2015|pisces
430|Your opinions on a number of issues will change profoundly over the next few days. New information will come your way that makes some of your most cherished convictions look rather out of date. Don’t cling to the past for the sake of it. |02-16-2015|pisces
431|There are times when it pays to be blunt and this is one of them. Others won’t mind what kind of language you use today so long as they understand where you are coming from and what you expect them to do next. |02-17-2015|pisces
432|Focus on your dreams and wishes and don’t worry if they seem a bit far-fetched. Today’s new moon makes all things possible, so aim high and, who knows, maybe it won’t be long before your dreams and wishes become realities. |02-18-2015|pisces
433|This is a good day for thinking but not such a good day for making decisions. Whatever you decide over the next 24 hours you are likely to have second thoughts about it come the weekend, so keep your options open as much as you can.|02-19-2015|pisces
434|If you can’t get what you want over the next 24 hours you will get the chance to make up for it tomorrow. As usual the only thing you have to fear is fear itself, so tell yourself you can do anything you want – and believe it.|02-20-2015|pisces
435|The only danger at the moment is that you will either set your sights too high or set them too low. You need to recognize both what your talents and your limitations happen to be and decide on your goals according to that. |02-21-2015|pisces
436|Opportunities will come your way over the next few days, so make the effort to get out and about and make things happen. Something you say or do when Venus, your ruler, links with Saturn on Tuesday could make you some serious money. |02-22-2015|pisces
437|Some people may say you are being too cautious, especially with money, but your sixth sense tells you this is not a good time to splash out. If there is something you really want get a friend or family member to buy it for you. |02-23-2015|pisces
438|Don’t worry if you find it hard to communicate with those around you over the next 24 hours – it may be the planets’ way of telling you this is not a good time to discuss serious matters. You will open up more later in the week.|02-24-2015|pisces
439|Ignore those you don’t get along with today and spend your time with people whose beliefs are in tune with your own. Group and social activities will go extremely well over the next few days, especially if you stick with your friends. |02-25-2015|pisces
440|According to the planets you will be taking on a lot more duties and responsibilities over the next few weeks. That may not be what you were hoping to hear but it will, in the long-term, earn you more respect – and more money too.|02-26-2015|pisces
441|You will go out of your way to calm someone down today but your efforts may not be enough. The fact is their emotions are a bit raw at the moment, so make allowances and don’t take what they say about you too seriously.|02-27-2015|pisces
442|Don’t say one thing while meaning another. And don’t give partners and loved ones the impression that you agree with them when you do not. State the truth as you see it and, if others don’t like it, debate the issue in a civilized way.|02-28-2015|pisces
443|You cannot fool people who know you well. With that fact in mind don’t try to tell a partner or loved one something that isn’t true, because they won’t believe you for a moment. You have a reputation for honesty – don’t lose it. |03-01-2015|pisces
444|Don’t worry if others say you are too conservative and don’t take enough risks. That’s nonsense. You know who you are and what you can do and if you follow your instincts over the coming week you will go much further than your critics. |03-02-2015|pisces
445|Don’t listen to your own doubts and fears today because they will cloud your mind and prevent you from reaching your true potential. And that would be a shame because there are so many things you could be winning at now.|03-03-2015|pisces
446|Someone will expect you to live up to the inflated image they have of you today but if you try you may come unstuck. Be who you are and do what you do and insist that everyone you know takes you as they find you.|03-04-2015|pisces
447|Chances are you will totally and utterly disagree with the advice you are given today. You could be right – maybe it is a complete load of nonsense – but what if it isn’t and you are the only one who doesn’t act on it?|03-05-2015|pisces
448|If someone gives you a hard time today don’t take it to heart: most likely they just need to let off steam and you happen to be the closest target. If you stay calm and in control they will make it up to you big time tomorrow.|03-06-2015|pisces
449|You have so much energy at your disposal right now that you could do a dozen things at once and still leave something in reserve. However, if you hold fire and wait until Monday or Tuesday you will discover a goal more worthy of your talents.|03-07-2015|pisces
450|You may feel sorry for someone who is going through hard times but, of course, they have only themselves to blame. Help them out by all means but let them know too that sooner or later they are going to have to get their act together.|03-08-2015|pisces
451|Don’t take someone’s negative remarks to heart because either they don’t mean what they say or they don’t realize how offensive it sounds to you. The last thing you need now is a slanging match with someone who should be your friend. |03-09-2015|pisces
452|The answers you seek are easy to find but you need to ask the right questions too. Take a look at the world around you. Who is in charge? Who is calling the shots? Answer that and everything else will fall into place.|03-10-2015|pisces
453|There is someone you are desperate to get to know better but can’t think of a way to make your approach. Don’t worry. What happens today will throw you together and before you know it you will be more than just friends.|03-11-2015|pisces
454|Take a long hard look at your financial position and decide what steps need to be taken to improve your long-term security. Earning more money would help, of course, but your main priority now is to cut back on luxuries and unnecessary expenses.|03-12-2015|pisces
455|What you expect to happen today and over the weekend most likely won’t, while what you don’t expect to happen most likely will. In which case there is no point making plans as they are certain to change. Take life as it comes. |03-13-2015|pisces
456|A work colleague will say something unfriendly today and to say you’re not happy about it is a bit of an understatement. But before you respond in kind make sure you have heard them correctly – it could be you who has the wrong end of the stick.|03-14-2015|pisces
457|You have been moving in the wrong direction and realize you will have to backtrack and find the point where you strayed off the path you were supposed to go down. On the other hand, some say all roads lead eventually to the same destination! |03-15-2015|pisces
458|You may be eager to push ahead with a project you know in your bones will be a success but the planets warn the timing is not quite right. At the very least wait until the solar eclipse on Friday – it will give you the boost you need. |03-16-2015|pisces
459|Promise yourself that you won’t get annoyed if certain people get on your nerves over the next few days. Most likely the real problem isn’t them but you and the closer you get to Friday’s eclipse the more sensitive you will be.|03-17-2015|pisces
460|Everyone has faults, everyone has failings, but not everyone has the strength to deal with them. But you do. The planets make it easy to confront the negative aspects of your personality now, so face up to them and overcome them.|03-18-2015|pisces
461|Friends and family are both on your mind at the moment but they are unlikely to mix, so focus on one and catch up on the other later on. The last thing you want over the next few days is a clash of personalities to deal with. |03-19-2015|pisces
462|If someone blames you for something that was not your fault by all means let them know you are not happy about it, but don’t go to extremes and make an enemy of them. Think before you speak – it could save you a lot of bother. |03-20-2015|pisces
463|You feel that your ideas are not being taken seriously but don’t worry because you will get the chance to prove yourself in weeks to come. This weekend though, keep telling yourself that you are on the right track – because you are. |03-21-2015|pisces
464|While everyone else is rushing here, there and everywhere trying to get things done today you will be strolling along without a care in the world. Either you have missed something important or maybe you’re the only one with the right attitude. |03-22-2015|pisces
465|There seems to be a lot of self doubt in your mind, which is not like you at all. Prove to yourself that you have what it takes to succeed by taking the sort of risk you would usually avoid. Take a chance – and be a star. |03-23-2015|pisces
466|Venus in your sign means you can get almost anything you want – and if you don’t believe that now you will before the day is over. However, go easy with the cash and the cards because you are also in one of your spendthrift moods.|03-24-2015|pisces
467|Venus in your sign makes the world look a kinder place, but don’t be fooled. Your attitude to those around you may have softened but you still need to take care, especially when dealing with money-related issues. Don’t be an easy touch. |03-25-2015|pisces
468|It is slowly but surely all coming right for you and over the next few days you will benefit in ways you cannot yet imagine. With Venus, your ruler, moving through your birth sign you cannot possibly lose, in love or in luck.|03-26-2015|pisces
469|Forget about financial matters and focus on your family. Get things in perspective today and remind yourself that, in the greater scheme of things, money is only bits of paper. Your own flesh and blood is, and always will be, more important.|03-27-2015|pisces
470|Don’t worry if a loved one is difficult to get along with this weekend – most likely they are going through a period of self-doubt and there is nothing much you can do about it. Give them space. They will get over it soon.|03-28-2015|pisces
471|However much you don’t feel like getting stuck into your workload you know if you don’t make a start now it may never get done. Someone in a position of authority is watching you closely – make sure they like what they see.|03-29-2015|pisces
472|You are trying to make sense of something that makes no sense at all, so it is no wonder you are getting frustrated. You don’t need to find an explanation for everything that happens in life. Some puzzles are best left unsolved. |03-30-2015|pisces
473|What happens today should be seen as the culmination of all the efforts you have made over the past few months. And even if you have not made much of an effort something will happen that brings a smile to your face. |03-31-2015|pisces
474|The pace of life will pick up over the next few days and that’s good news because you have been operating well below capacity. With Mars in your sign you will find it ridiculously easy to get things done – but get others to help you too.|04-01-2015|pisces
475|You will say the right thing in the right way today, especially when dealing with people in positions of power. However, you don’t need to boast about how good you are. If they don’t know already they will learn over the next few days.|04-02-2015|pisces
476|What is the one thing you desire above everything else? If you know what it is and if you have the confidence to go after it there is every chance you will get it over the next few days. But only you can make it happen.|04-03-2015|pisces
477|You may not be getting the support and encouragement you need at the moment but don’t worry about it. It simply means that those you live and work with have a lot on their minds this weekend. Maybe you should be supporting them.|04-04-2015|pisces
478|The last few days have been hectic and if you are smart you will now slow down a bit and make sure your physical, metal and emotional batteries are recharged. If you don’t it won’t be long before you are showing signs of fatigue. |04-05-2015|pisces
479|The less others know about your aims and ambitions this week the better, especially if you are working towards a goal that is likely to make others jealous if you succeed – and you will. The less your rivals know about it the better.|04-06-2015|pisces
480|You may be tempted to give up on something that is not working out the way you expected but is that wise? The planets urge you to stick with it a while longer because a breakthrough is imminent. If you give up now you will regret it later.|04-07-2015|pisces
481|Try not to change things for the sake of it over the next 24 hours. According to the planets you are thinking of altering something simply because others have been criticizing you for being too traditional. They’re right, you are – but so what?|04-08-2015|pisces
482|Either you will set your sights too high or set them too low over the next 24 hours. You could, of course, surprise everyone and find a sensible middle way but how likely is that? You’re in one of your “take it to the limit” moods!|04-09-2015|pisces
483|If you have a good idea today you must let others know about it, especially those who can support you and guide you. Don’t keep your biggest and best ideas to yourself: sharing what you know is always good business. |04-10-2015|pisces
484|Changing methods and routines is rarely easy but the current cosmic outlook makes it simpler than usual, for you at least. Whatever changes you think are necessary you should get on with them now. There’s no time like the present.|04-11-2015|pisces
485|Don’t worry too much if something happens over the next few days that throws your plans into disarray. Everyone around you will be dealing with chaos and confusion. The good news is that you will deal with it better than most.|04-12-2015|pisces
486|The Sun in Aries at this time of year tends to bring forth self-doubt but the good news is that the Sun will be moving into your sign in a week’s time and then your confidence will return. Between now and then, keep a low profile. |04-13-2015|pisces
487|You are in no mood to follow the herd. With mind planet Mercury moving into your sign you will go your own way and do your own thing even if the whole world is against you. You’ll make a big impression, and a good one too.|04-14-2015|pisces
488|You have been worrying too much about money and business matters lately but as from today your fears should subside a little. The moment you stop worrying about your cash flow situation is the moment it will start getting better.|04-15-2015|pisces
489|A few days from now the Sun will move into your birth sign and a new solar year will begin, so try not to start anything new. Conserve your energy today and over the weekend – because you are going to need it very soon. |04-17-2015|pisces
490|The Sun remains in the most introspective area of your chart only until Monday, so put aside some time over the next 48 hours for quiet contemplation and to consider your options. It could be the most important weekend of the year.|04-18-2015|pisces
491|It’s not often you splash out on gifts for other people but with the Sun moving into your sign today you are in an optimistic, and therefore generous, mood. Don’t go too mad though – your resources are limited after all.|04-20-2015|pisces
492|It’s time to finish those tasks that should have been completed a long time ago. The Sun in your sign means your energy levels will peak over the next few days, so get on top of your workload so you can stop worrying about it.|04-21-2015|pisces
493|You will have plenty to say for yourself today and as far as some people are concerned you are saying too much. But that’s too bad because you have kept your thoughts to yourself long enough – now you intend to make up for lost time.|04-22-2015|pisces
494|With the Sun in your sign your confidence is high but you still have a vague feeling that everything could fall apart at any moment. Don’t worry, it won’t, but it could be your intuition is trying to tell you something. What could it be?|04-23-2015|pisces
495|If you are happy with your life as it is then don’t change a thing, no matter how hard others try to persuade you to set new goals. You are at your best when you know where you stand. Security is more important to you than ambition. |04-24-2015|pisces
496|You may be the life and soul of the party at the moment but some of the people you interact with this weekend won’t be in the mood for fun and games. Don’t get in their way but don’t let them get in your way either. |04-25-2015|pisces
497|All things are possible for you now but for best results you should focus on just one or two aims. If you spread yourself too thin your energy and enthusiasm will be used up quickly and your excitement will wane quickly too. |04-26-2015|pisces
498|There will be a clash of egos as the new week begins and although you won’t be directly involved you will be affected. Under no circumstances agree to take sides, because even if you choose right you will lose out in some way.|04-27-2015|pisces
499|You are full of energy and enthusiasm now but that does not mean you should throw caution to the wind. By all means be bold today but have a goal too, something you can work towards, if only by indirect means.|04-28-2015|pisces
500|Let your mind roam where it will over the next 24 hours. Give yourself permission to dream. The dreams you have may seem far-fetched to some but chances are it won’t be long before they are no longer dreams but realities.|04-29-2015|pisces
501|You have come a long way in a short space of time and will go even further over the next few weeks. But first you must slow down a bit and make sure you are still on the right track. Don’t lose sight of your long-term goals.|04-30-2015|pisces
502|The more others try to change your way of looking at things the more you will dig in your heels, and you are right to resist. Only you know what is best for you and your instincts tell you this is a time for consolidation, not change.|05-01-2015|pisces
503|Try not to take what you hear to heart over the next 48 hours. It may be true that someone is trying to make you feel bad – most likely because it makes them feel good – but you are under no obligation to play their silly games.|05-02-2015|pisces
504|Make your plans and make them big – but keep them secret too. If you are too eager to show the world how smart you are then you might let slip something that boosts your rivals’ chances of success at the expense of your own. |05-03-2015|pisces
505|Strive to be nice to people today, even if they are not always nice to you. A full moon in your opposite sign of Scorpio will help you realize that people everywhere are much the same – if not quite as brilliant as you. |05-04-2015|pisces
506|Some people think you are lazy but that’s far from the truth. It’s just that you see no point exerting yourself for things that are of no importance. It’s better to be ambitious about one thing than lukewarm about many things.|05-05-2015|pisces
507|You will get the chance to climb several rungs up the ladder of success over the next few days but there is also a danger that you could slip and fall all the way to the bottom. It’s all part of the game – smile whatever happens. |05-06-2015|pisces
508|Do something different over the next 24 hours, something that those who believe you are traditional by nature would never guess you are capable of. The fact is you have been far too predictable of late. It’s time to get yourself noticed.|05-07-2015|pisces
509|Make the most of Mars in your sign to get things done and let the people you live and work with know that you won’t be pushed around. You don’t have to be aggressive about it but you do have to protect your interests.|05-08-2015|pisces
510|You could easily go over the top and make claims or statements you don’t know to be true over the next 48 hours. You may think that does not matter but the planets warn it could cost you dear, so watch what you say.|05-09-2015|pisces
511|Over the next few days you will find that some things that usually come easy to you will need extra care and extra effort. Most importantly you must take care with money as impulse buying could lead you astray in a big and costly way. |05-10-2015|pisces
512|Mars leaves your birth sign tomorrow, so if there is anything that needs finishing you should knuckle down and get on with it now. Your efforts will not go unrecognized or unrewarded – the powers that be have been watching. |05-11-2015|pisces
513|Mars leaves your sign today but that does not mean you can no longer be positive. On the contrary, in some areas you can be even more positive than usual. Material issues generally and money matters in particular are doubly important now.|05-12-2015|pisces
