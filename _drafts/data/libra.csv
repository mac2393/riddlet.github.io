0|There may be a number of minor setbacks over the next few days but you will handle them with ease and still find time to have fun. The most important thing is that you are on the move – you’ll miss out if you sit still.|12-01-2013|libra
1|The more you search for a solution to a problem of some kind the more it seems to elude you. Maybe you are trying too hard. Maybe you should focus on something else for a while. The answer will come when it’s ready. |12-02-2013|libra
2|Your energy may be high at the moment but don’t burn yourself out. Social invitations will come thick and fast over the next few days but you are under no obligation to go along to them all, or even any of them.|12-03-2013|libra
3|Use your head today, especially when dealing with people who tend to get emotional over what are really quite trivial matters. No matter how agitated they may get you should remain calm and stay focused on the facts.|12-04-2013|libra
4|Get a change of scene today. The more you are on the move the more likely it is you will meet people who bring a smile to your face – and what could be more important than that? Look for similarities with others, not differences.|12-05-2013|libra
5|It’s not like you to look back and wish things had been different but that may be your attitude today. Okay, so you could have done a lot of things differently and some things better but that’s life. Only ever look forwards.|12-06-2013|libra
6|As Mars moves into your birth sign today you will find it so much easier to be assertive. Not everyone will agree with your aims but, to be blunt, you couldn’t care less. Only one person’s views count with you – your own!|12-07-2013|libra
7|What others say and do may influence your thinking but it is still your responsibility to make sure things work out the right way. Above all this week you must not allow rivals to blame you for their own feeble failings. |12-08-2013|libra
8|Make a point of respecting other people’s right to have opinions you don’t agree with. If you must criticize what they say at least do so in a civilized fashion. Resist the urge to be sarcastic because that will make the situation ten times worse.|12-09-2013|libra
9|Can you trust your senses? Most of the time maybe but today you would be wise to question what your eyes and ears tell you. Are you seeing and hearing what’s really there or what certain people want you to believe is there?|12-10-2013|libra
10|According to the planets this is a good day for personal issues, especially partnerships. Where affairs of the heart are concerned you can hardly put a foot wrong at the moment – and a little of what you fancy will do you good.|12-11-2013|libra
11|At some stage today you will realize that you are not going to get far with a joint project of some kind, thanks mainly to people dragging their feet. You will though make progress in areas where you can work on your own.|12-12-2013|libra
12|Don’t over-extend yourself on the work front or you may find that your energy takes a nose-dive early next week. Today’s Jupiter-Saturn link will help you persuade others to do things for you. You don’t have to do it all on your own|12-13-2013|libra
13|You may think you are determined and driven to succeed but with Mars in your sign you can and you must push yourself twice as hard as you usually do. Personally and professionally all things are possible, starting this very weekend.|12-14-2013|libra
14|If you cut corners or disobey rules this week you are sure to regret it. Even if you are the sort of Libra who enjoys taking risks you are strongly advised to play it safe. Don’t give your enemies an opening to make you look bad.|12-15-2013|libra
15|You will get your way on the work front easily enough today but you may upset a few people along the way. That won’t worry you in the slightest. You are determined to make your mark and make some serious money too.|12-16-2013|libra
16|You can be extremely persuasive at times but don’t go too far and demand that people change their views and opinions. Communication is about the exchange of ideas, not forcing your ideas on those who clearly don’t want them.|12-17-2013|libra
17|At some stage today your frustration is likely to bubble over and you will say or do something that you later regret. But, even so, it’s good to remind those around you that your patience is finite. It keeps them on their toes.|12-18-2013|libra
18|What happens over the next few days will help you to understand that your priorities are wrong, that you are worrying about the things you cannot change while neglecting the things you can. It’s time to get your head back together. |12-19-2013|libra
19|You may be tempted to do something drastic today but the planets warn the results are as likely to be negative as positive. Why not just wait a while and let the current situation work itself out? There’s no need to rush.|12-20-2013|libra
20|It’s okay to be cautious when dealing with people you don’t know very well but don’t let it get to a level where you distrust every word they say for no good reason. Most people, even strangers, are still honest in their dealings.|12-21-2013|libra
21|You always have plenty to say for yourself but for a while at least it might be wise to button your lip and listen to what others have to say. You could learn something to your advantage this week, if you are willing to use your ears.|12-22-2013|libra
22|You are beginning to realize that you have placed your trust in someone who is playing a different game completely, one which they alone are guaranteed to win. Now you have rumbled them you can and you must turn the tables.|12-23-2013|libra
23|Partners and colleagues will demand more of your time and attention today and if you are smart you will give it to them. If you do small favors for others now chances are they will do big favors for you later on. That’s how it works.|12-24-2013|libra
24|What you need to remember now is that brains will beat brawn every time. No matter how powerful or how well connected an opponent may be you can get the better of them, simply by using your superior intellect.|12-25-2013|libra
25|If you have been taking a loved one for granted of late this could be a tricky day. Somehow you need to convince them that your feelings are still the same but it will take more than just words. You may have to get romantic!|12-26-2013|libra
26|There is someone in your world you need to pay more attention to. This person has always been important to you but maybe they have not always received the love and respect they deserve. Make them feel like a million dollars today.|12-27-2013|libra
27|The planets indicate that some kind of breakthrough is imminent, so keep believing that you will succeed and keep believing that the rewards will be huge. Both in your personal life and at work the sky is the limit – so soar.|12-28-2013|libra
28|You may be a bit sensitive at the moment but that’s okay because, if anything, you have not been sensitive enough in recent weeks and need to redress the balance. Some people seem to think you lack empathy. Make it your aim to prove them wrong.|12-29-2013|libra
29|Others may frown at your behavior today but only because they are jealous that you are enjoying yourself so much. Should you feel sorry for them? No you should not. But you can be a good example and show them how easy it is to have fun.|12-30-2013|libra
30|The only danger now is that you may overestimate your own strength while underestimating what rivals are capable of — and that’s a recipe for disaster. Remember, too, that some people are naturally stubborn — they won’t be moved. |12-31-2013|libra
31|Resist the urge to show any kind of favoritism today, especially on the home front where you could upset a loved one if they think you are doing more for others than you are for them. It may not be true but that’s the way they will see it.|01-01-2014|libra
32|Even if you are one of those rare Librans who prefer to keep their thoughts private, you will have plenty to say for yourself today. The only danger is you may say too much and reveal valuable information. Keep good ideas to yourself.|01-03-2014|libra
33|If you believe that something bad is going to happen, then most likely it will. When negative thoughts get a hold on your mind you create subconscious ripples that attract downbeat people and harmful events. Get a grip on yourself.|01-04-2014|libra
34|Try to be more understanding of someone who has let you down or in some other way incurred your displeasure. No doubt they deserve to be treated roughly but, on this occasion, they will respond better to encouragement than to criticism.|01-05-2014|libra
35|You may think that you can do as you please and get away with it but the planets warn if you go too far today you could create a backlash that is difficult to contain. Maybe you should play it safe, just this once.|01-06-2014|libra
36|It will pay you to be secretive, especially if you are working on a plan that requires the element of surprise to succeed. If people start sniffing around, asking what you are up to, tell them anything but the truth. Yes, you may have to lie. |01-07-2014|libra
37|This is an important time for you and you will be making at least one and maybe several major changes to your lifestyle. The full moon on the 16th will clear away obstacles. Between now and then make your plans and make them big.|01-08-2014|libra
38|All things are possible – you feel in your bones that you can take on the world and win – and you’re right, you can. But why make a battle of it when you have the charm to get what you want without a struggle? Or is that what you enjoy?|01-09-2014|libra
39|It is important that you make an effort to put squabbles behind you. That might seem like a tall order considering how fragile certain relationships have been of late but it will be easier than you imagine, so imagine it and do it.|01-10-2014|libra
40|Stay true to your principles and don’t stoop to underhand methods or tactics, no matter how great the prize. If you lower your standards even a little you will lessen the morality gap that exists between you and most other people.|01-11-2014|libra
41|The best way to deal with criticism is to ignore it. Focus your mind on your work over the next seven days and give the critics a miss. Most likely they are talking rubbish as usual – some people, it seems, just can’t help themselves.|01-12-2014|libra
42|You may feel sorry for someone whose luck appears to have deserted them but you are still advised to keep your distance and not get personally involved. Most likely the universe is trying to teach them something. Don’t get in the way.|01-13-2014|libra
43|You will hear something today that does not exactly fill you with joyous feelings but it’s not as bad as you think it is. It may even, in a strange sort of way, be the forerunner of good news over the longer term, so don’t despair just yet.|01-14-2014|libra
44|Are you in charge of your emotions, or are your emotions in charge of you? That is the question you need to ask of yourself and, if you are honest, it will most likely be the latter. Whatever else happens, don’t let your fears damage your career.|01-15-2014|libra
45|Someone who envies your calm demeanor will turn up the heat today in the hope that you will start to sweat, but what they don’t know is that you thrive on this sort of pressure. Not even today’s full moon can crack your composure.|01-16-2014|libra
46|There are plenty of challenges in your life at the moment but you don’t have to make an issue of every one of them. You will progress quicker if you pick your battles carefully and ignore whatever does not take you closer to your goals.|01-17-2014|libra
47|You have been rather emotional of late, no doubt due to the Sun’s transit of one of the more sensitive areas of your chart. As from Monday though your world will be a much brighter and much happier place – so dry your eyes!|01-18-2014|libra
48|Not only is Mars positioned nicely in your birth sign but the Sun moves into the most dynamic area of your chart as well this week. It matters not if the world is against you: there is just no way you are going to lose.|01-19-2014|libra
49|If there is something of an artistic nature you have been thinking of trying now is the time to stop thinking and start doing. With the Sun moving into the most dynamic area of your chart you can and you will make a name for yourself.|01-20-2014|libra
50|This is no time for doubts or second thoughts. Throw caution to the wind and let your instincts guide you. This is a great time for creative activities and affairs of the heart, so be creative about your love life and love everything you create.|01-21-2014|libra
51|First appearances can be deceptive, so don’t be put off if someone you meet today seems a bit too serious for your tastes. The planets suggest the two of you will be working with each other a lot, so do what you can to put them at ease.|01-22-2014|libra
52|The Sun in Aquarius does wonders for your confidence, so it’s unlikely you will stop to think before you speak or tone down your remarks to save other people’s blushes. And why should you? It’s not your fault the truth is painful.|01-23-2014|libra
53|No matter how many brilliant ideas you have buzzing round your brain they don’t mean a thing unless you do something with them. For too long you have been coming up with grand plans but not going any further. Now it’s time to act.|01-24-2014|libra
54|You may not be under quite so much pressure on the work front now but don’t use that as an excuse to lower your standards or not try so hard. Important people are still watching you, so make sure they like what they see.|01-25-2014|libra
55|The combination of a new moon in the most dynamic area of your solar chart and an inspiring Sun-Uranus link means that obstacles are few and opportunities are limitless. You are at a peak right now, so go find a mountain to climb.|01-26-2014|libra
56|You have been avoiding taking some kind of decision but the time is rapidly approaching when you must act swiftly. You know what has to be done and you know the importance of getting it right, so quit stalling and get busy.|01-27-2014|libra
57|Someone in a position of authority will look on you kindly today. What have you done to deserve their support? Who knows, but you would be a fool not to make the most of it. There’s nothing wrong with being flavor of the month.|01-28-2014|libra
58|Relationships of the romantic kind are well starred today. Let the object of your affection know that they are, always have been and always will be number one in your heart. If you do that, the next few days will be extra special.|01-29-2014|libra
59|You can sense that something marvelous is going to happen over the next 24 hours but you don’t know what it is. That’s part of the fun. Whatever it happens to be, make the most of it. Marvelous things rarely stay marvelous for long.|01-30-2014|libra
60|It will pay you to come on a little less strong today, especially at work but also at home. You don’t need to prove yourself. You don’t need to impress the powers that be. In fact you will impress people more if you switch off and have fun.|01-31-2014|libra
61|Everyone seems to be on a totally different wavelength to you at the moment, so you can’t expect much support, not even from friends and family members. You don’t care in the least. You don’t need their support. You can cope on your own.|02-01-2014|libra
62|You may have to cuts corners and bend rules to get things done over the next 24 hours but it will be worth it. If will certainly save you time, much of which will be taken up trying to explain to others what you are doing and why.|02-03-2014|libra
63|Anyone who thinks you are not ambitious will get a shock today as you push yourself harder than ever. But while it is okay to be hard on yourself it is not okay to be hard on friends, loved ones and relatives. Stay balanced. Stay calm.|02-04-2014|libra
64|Something you hear on the work front could benefit you enormously, but only if you have the presence of mind to act quickly. You are not the only one who is looking for a way to get ahead, so stay alert and be decisive and dynamic. |02-05-2014|libra
65|There is sure to be some kind of disorder today, most likely on the work front where your colleagues may discover that they are not up to keeping the promises they made. You, of course, could see it coming, so you won’t be fazed in the slightest.|02-06-2014|libra
66|Put the finishing touches to something of a creative nature, something that could bring you the kind of recognition and rewards you believe you deserve. Even if it doesn’t make you rich and famous it will still be a job well done.|02-07-2014|libra
67|The problems you are having with a new working routine are minor and likely to be short-lived, so don’t let them annoy you. And don’t let other people tell you that you need to change course. They don’t know what they are talking about.|02-08-2014|libra
68|Mars in your sign makes you confident and assertive but you are still advised to start the week slowly and carefully. Feel your way and don’t take too many risks. Save yourself for next weekend when you’ll be a winner in everything you do.|02-10-2014|libra
69|There is no point arguing with people who will always see things differently to you. It takes all sorts to make a world and though that does not mean you have to like them it does sometimes mean you have to put up with them. |02-11-2014|libra
70|You have been chopping and changing far too much of late. According to the planets you must choose a route and stick with it today. If you don’t it may be several more weeks before you get the chance to regain control of your affairs.|02-12-2014|libra
71|Be careful what you say over the next few days because certain people won’t take kindly to you making light of things that they take seriously. Others, however, will think you are the funniest Libra ever. Choose your audience carefully.|02-13-2014|libra
72|It may be annoying that someone is dragging their feet and generally making life hard for you but don’t make an issue of it. The full moon means you just have to accept that not everyone thinks or moves or acts as fast as you.|02-14-2014|libra
73|You know what you want, you know where to get it and with Mars, planet of energy and ambition, on good form this weekend there is no doubt at all you will soon reach your goal. There’s just no stopping you at the moment.|02-15-2014|libra
74|Are the good times about to end? Will you have to pay for the easy ride you’ve had in recent weeks? No, of course not, but as from tomorrow you may have to make more of an effort to get what takes no effort at all today.|02-17-2014|libra
75|If you find that you are lacking in energy today resist the urge to push yourself even harder. Now that the Sun is moving through the wellbeing area of your chart you must pace yourself sensibly. Get the balance right between work and rest.|02-18-2014|libra

81|Travel and social plans may have to be changed today as the planets bring to light information that casts doubt on other people’s motives. If you don’t feel 100 per cent sure they are on the level then maybe you should stay at home.|02-24-2014|libra
82|Take care you don’t get too close to a situation and lose your sense of perspective. You need to make a conscious decision to stand back from what you are doing and see the bigger picture – it’s always there for you if you know how to look.|02-25-2014|libra
83|It would be nice if you could solve all the problems of the world but be realistic: you can’t even come close. What you can do though is join with those who share your views and aim to change one specific thing for the better. Get to it.|02-26-2014|libra

89|Anyone who disagrees with your right to dictate terms will be out in the cold before they know what is happening. Most of the time you are quite happy-go-lucky but today the happiest and luckiest people will be those who stay out of your way!|03-04-2014|libra
90|Too often in the past you have lacked the confidence to follow through on a good idea and make a name for yourself. Now though you will look and act as if you just can’t fail. And you won’t. In fact you will make it look easy.|03-05-2014|libra

94|Your sixth sense tells you that something unexpected is about to happen, but that is no reason to lock the doors and pull down the blinds. You know the old saying: If you’ve done nothing wrong you’ve got nothing to be scared of.|03-09-2014|libra
95|You will make an impression over the next seven days but will it be of the right sort? That depends on how well you get along with the people you work with and for. Be confident but try not to be arrogant or domineering.|03-10-2014|libra
96|The past few weeks have been tough and the next 24 hours is likely to bring challenges too, but nothing will happen that you don’t have the intelligence and the courage to overcome. You’re at your best with your back to the wall.|03-11-2014|libra
97|A plan or project that has been in a state of limbo since the start of the year will begin to move forward again as from today. Don’t try to do everything at once though. You’ll catch up eventually, so be smart and start slow.|03-12-2014|libra

99|If you feel the need to brag about your success then go right ahead. It’s not often you make a big noise about how well you have done, so every once in a while it’s okay. You certainly have lots to be proud of. Let everyone know.|03-14-2014|libra
100|You must put your own interests first this weekend, because if you allow others to persuade you that their needs are more important you will lose out in a big way. It won’t hurt to be a bit more suspicious than usual. |03-15-2014|libra
101|Don’t let your disappointment over one little thing ruin what should be a glorious week. Also, don’t think it is wrong to be happy when there are so many people who are unhappy. Do you want to change the world? Then make it laugh.|03-16-2014|libra

111|Self-confidence is the key to success, so believe in what you are doing and believe that sooner or later your efforts will be rewarded. Remember too that the world you experience “out there” is largely a reflection of what goes on inside your head.|03-26-2014|libra
112|You will hear something to your benefit today but your suspicious nature could hold you back from taking advantage of it. Unless there is clear evidence that someone is trying to trick you then you must take a chance. If you don’t, you’ll regret it.|03-27-2014|libra

121|For some strange reason you can’t get started on a project you have been planning for some time. Maybe the universe is trying to tell you something. Maybe it isn’t quite the right time to begin. What’s the rush? It can wait.|04-05-2014|libra
122|Make a conscious effort to be nice to people, even if they don’t deserve it. The planets warn you are going to need help before the end of the week and you are more likely to get it if others feel obligated to you in some way.|04-06-2014|libra
123|Where before there were so many misunderstandings there will now be an awareness of how much certain people mean to you and why minor differences of opinion are of no importance at all. Be friends with everyone, but most of all with yourself.|04-07-2014|libra
124|Creative endeavors are under excellent stars, so if there is some kind of artistic project you want to get started on don’t wait any longer. Remember too that there is no such thing as the perfect time – the present moment is all you ever have.|04-08-2014|libra
125|Whatever happens today, be it good, bad or indifferent, try not to take it too seriously. Others may think it’s the end of the world, or the start of a golden age, but you know it’s nowhere near as dramatic as that. It’s life, that’s all.|04-09-2014|libra
126|Make sure you know what you are talking about today, especially if you are dealing with people who are experts of some sort. If you make claims that cannot be backed up with facts they won’t hesitate to make you look silly.|04-10-2014|libra
127|If you say something you know to be untrue today the planets warn you will be found out, much to your embarrassment. There is absolutely no reason why you should lie or give false information. What could be so bad about the truth?|04-11-2014|libra

132|Partners and colleagues have the upper hand at the moment and you need to accept that fact. There are powers in the world that cannot be beaten by either charm or force of personality, of which you have plenty. Stay calm and let things just happen.|04-16-2014|libra
133|It may be time to let certain people know that they can have no say in your future. Far too many friends and relatives seem to be telling you what you should do but each and every one of them is wrong. Follow your heart – it knows the way.|04-17-2014|libra
134|You may have certain duties to fulfill but you don’t have to be a slave to other people’s demands. Make sure everyone – friends, family and work colleagues alike – know that what you do for them you do out of the goodness of your heart.|04-18-2014|libra
135|Business issues and money matters will take on added importance this weekend. Make sure anything to do with property and investments is handled with care over the next few days, and over the next few weeks. There’s a lot at stake.|04-19-2014|libra
136|Try not to lose your sense of perspective this week or common sense could go right out of the window, with disastrous results. It may seem as if everyone but you is riding the gravy train and cashing in but it’s not all about money you know.|04-20-2014|libra
137|You won’t care in the slightest whose toes you may be treading on today, you will wade in where angels fear to tread and put the world to rights. Or maybe you’ll make it even worse than before – but you WILL make an impression!|04-21-2014|libra
138|It’s one thing to make bold decisions but it’s another to make sure they are the right decisions. There is a great deal at stake at the moment and if you call it wrong the repercussions could be massive, so think deeply and act cautiously.|04-22-2014|libra
139|Whatever it is that you fear you need to put a name to it because only then will you be able to face it and conquer it. Most likely you have been worrying for no good reason but even if your anxieties are valid they don’t have to be such a big deal.|04-23-2014|libra
140|Make sure what you wish for is what you truly desire because once it is in your possession you may not be able to give it back again. Also, be careful when making promises to friends. They will hold you to them come what may.|04-24-2014|libra
141|No matter how determined you may be to make a good impression on people in positions of power you must not run yourself into the ground. Make sure the delicate equilibrium between your mind, body and emotions is not disturbed.|04-25-2014|libra
142|Have a clear out this weekend. Get rid of not just all the material junk you have accumulated but all the emotional junk too. But make sure you only get rid of those things that are negative – some things are still worth keeping.|04-26-2014|libra
143|Money matters of all kinds are under favorable influences at the moment and if you think sensibly and act wisely your financial position is sure to improve. Think about the future too: how can you invest now to get more later on?|04-27-2014|libra
144|According to the planets you are carrying too much emotional baggage and need to give your feelings a thorough spring clean. Once you have confronted your fears you may well realize there was precious little to worry about in the first place.|04-28-2014|libra
145|There is no point arguing with people who simply refuse to see sense. It may be tempting to show them up with your superior knowledge but why bother? Eventually they will see just how foolish they have been but don’t waste your time on them.|04-29-2014|libra
146|You must not take any unnecessary risks today, especially with money. Keep your cash in your pocket and don’t let anyone, no matter how smooth-talking, persuade you there is easy money to be made, because it’s your money they are after.|04-30-2014|libra
147|Mars in your sign endows you with courage and confidence but other aspects warn you can’t do it all on your own. You need to rediscover the joys of being a team player, of how good it feels to share success with other people.|05-01-2014|libra
148|You may have to wait a few weeks before you get the chance to put your big idea into effect but don’t be impatient. The more time you give it to percolate through your brain the more likely it is to be an outstanding success.|05-02-2014|libra
149|You will need plenty of self-belief over the next few days. Not only are major changes coming your way but you will come under intense pressure to conform in your reaction to them. Don’t do it. Be free and follow your conscience.|05-03-2014|libra
150||05-04-2014|libra
151|What you have to do over the next few days may not be what you would choose to do but if you approach it in the right frame of mind it can still be fun. More significantly, it will get important people back on your side.|05-05-2014|libra
152|Don’t try to force others to do your bidding today because they will make such an emotional scene that even you will be embarrassed. If there is something that needs doing either do it yourself or hire someone to do it for you.|05-06-2014|libra
153|You may have been a bit too fixed in your opinions of late but with mind planet Mercury moving in your favor again you will get the chance to review your beliefs and adjust them to fit reality – rather than the other way round!|05-07-2014|libra
154|Whatever else you do over the next 24 hours don’t cut corners or break rules, because you won’t get away with it. Resist the temptation to do anything dishonest, not just because it is dishonest but also because you really don’t need to.|05-08-2014|libra
155|You should expect a certain amount of deception over the next 24 hours, even from people you think you can trust. Don’t take anything that happens too seriously and don’t hold grudges against people who let you down. It happens.|05-09-2014|libra
156|You need to get serious about a money matter or business issue you have been neglecting of late. You may also have to get tough with people who have not being playing straight with you – even to the point of ending a relationship.|05-10-2014|libra
157|You will be in a generous mood over the next few days, especially with those who have been generous to you in the past. But don’t limit your kindness to people you know personally do something of a charitable nature for strangers too.|05-11-2014|libra
158|Some things may seem funny to you but not everyone will laugh at your jokes today. Most likely it’s because they resent you being the center of attention all the time. That’s too bad – the limelight is there to be hogged.|05-12-2014|libra
159|Fears you thought had been put behind you will return in strange and unexpected ways. However, if you face up to those fears and deal with them bravely the planets indicate this will be the very last time they bother you.|05-13-2014|libra
160|If you let your emotions influence what should be a purely logical decision today you could end up out of pocket. Where money and other material matters are concerned you must not take risks, not even if the potential rewards are great.|05-14-2014|libra
161|Let the people you feel closest to know how much you need them and appreciate them and love them. It’s not true that Librans lack emotion and anyone who thinks that will have no choice but to think again over the next 24 hours.|05-15-2014|libra
162|At some point today you will realize that so many of the things you have been worrying about are simply not worth the time or the effort. Once you understand that you will find it easier to focus on what is genuinely important.|05-16-2014|libra
163|Nothing will worry you and nothing will put you off what you are planning to do. You instinctively know this is the time to take action, while the Sun is still moving in your favor. You’ve got to be quick though – do something today.|05-17-2014|libra
164|No doubt you can’t wait to get to work on your plans but don’t be so eager that you make a false start. You have plenty of time to make your mark, so see to it that the foundations are strong. Take it a step at a time.|05-18-2014|libra
165|You like to talk and it is something you are good at but the planets warn it might be better if you said nothing at all today. If are the kind of Libra who likes to chat for the sake of it you could give away too much information.|05-19-2014|libra
166|You should know by now that change is the only constant in life and the really good news is that the changes coming your way over the next few days will delight you. One of the best times of the year is about to begin.|05-20-2014|libra
167|There will be an obvious change in your mood over the next two or three days. Where before you were highly strung and often uptight now you will be relaxed and easygoing. Don’t take life too seriously. Having fun is what matters.|05-21-2014|libra
168|You will be on inspired form over the next few days. Every idea you have – and you will have plenty – will be touched by genius in some way. Remember though that ideas mean nothing unless you do something with them.|05-22-2014|libra
169|One of the best times of the year for you is now under way, so get rid of any negative attitudes you may have and start looking forward to all the good things that will be coming your way. Be positive in thought, word and deed.|05-23-2014|libra
170|Go out and have a good time this weekend. You have had so many serious things to deal with of late that you seem to have forgotten what it means to have fun but it won’t take much to remind yourself – it’s what you do best after all.|05-24-2014|libra
171|The Sun in Gemini will encourage you to take the kind of risks you usually tend to avoid and Wednesday’s new moon will bring the perfect opportunity to expand your horizons and be more adventurous. What have you got to lose?|05-25-2014|libra
172|A lot of things that have been hidden from you in recent weeks and months will be revealed over the next few days. Try not to dwell on the many little things that make up your life – it’s the big picture that matters now.|05-26-2014|libra
173|It will feel as if a great weight has been lifted from your shoulders today. Money worries, especially, will begin to fade and you can start having fun again without constantly having to check how much cash you’ve got in your purse.|05-27-2014|libra
174|You have a lot to say for yourself and most of it is worth listening to, but be careful you don’t say anything that might upset people whose support you are going to need. It’s good to have opinions but not so good if they cause you trouble.|05-28-2014|libra
175|If there has been some sort of dispute or disagreement now is the time to patch things up. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to business issues. There is always a solution – it’s simply a question of how hard to choose to look.|05-29-2014|libra
176|Mars in your sign makes life more adventurous and exciting. Wherever you go and whatever you do today you must seize the initiative and make sure the world knows you are a force to be reckoned with – a force of nature in fact.|05-30-2014|libra
177|Mars in your sign makes you assertive and ambitious and today’s link with the Sun in Gemini means everyone is on your side too. There has rarely been a better time to push yourself forward and take what it is you desire.|05-31-2014|libra
178|You may think you can get away with outrageous behavior, and maybe you are right, but that does not mean you have to behave in ways that are guaranteed to annoy certain people. Keep your excesses at a reasonable level this week.|06-01-2014|libra
179|This is still one of the best times of the year for you but that does not mean you can do as you please. The planets warn you may need to take extra care today and tomorrow when dealing with travel plans and social arrangements.|06-02-2014|libra
180|Your confidence may be high now the Sun is transiting the sympathetic sign of Gemini but don’t get carried away. Other aspects warn there are things going on behind the scenes that suggest you could be in for a shock.|06-03-2014|libra
181|You need to get out of the habit of trying to do everything alone. It will pay you to be a little less independent over the next few days. Just because you don’t like certain people does not mean you can’t work with them.|06-04-2014|libra
182|You are in an adventurous mood but the planets warn this may not be the best time to venture into areas you don’t know much about. Wait until the full moon on the 13th has come and gone before moving outside your comfort zone.|06-05-2014|libra
183|The slightest little thing is likely to set you off today but on this occasion getting angry is actually the best thing you could do. It will certainly remind others that you are not the sort of person who can be taken for granted.|06-06-2014|libra
184|Don’t cling to things, be they people or possessions, that need to pass out of your life. Not only do you no longer need them but the longer you hold on the longer it will be before better things are able to come into your life.|06-07-2014|libra
185|Be careful what you say this week, because careless words could have a negative impact on your image. That may not worry you now but it will later on when you are overlooked for a promotion or a pay increase. Say nice things only.|06-08-2014|libra
186|Where money matters are concerned you would be wise not to take risks because most likely the odds are stacked against you. A hunch might pay off but more likely it will put you in a situation where one loss leads to another.|06-09-2014|libra
187|A positive attitude is essential over the next 24 hours because if you let even one negative thought creep into your mind it’s likely to get stuck there. Life is good and getting better by the moment – believe it, it’s true.|06-10-2014|libra
188|Don’t pay too much attention to material things today. What matters is not how much money you earn or what amazing possessions you own but how happy you are on the inside. Bank accounts are one thing – spiritual accounts quite another.|06-11-2014|libra
189|You are attaching too much importance to issues that only a few days ago would have meant nothing to you at all. Why that should be is impossible to say but you need to ease up a bit. In the greater scheme of things, what do they matter?|06-12-2014|libra
190|You seem a bit excitable at the moment but that’s okay – most likely nothing bad will come of it. In fact this looks like being a good time for you, especially if you are traveling or planning a vacation for later in the year.|06-13-2014|libra
191|You seem remarkably passionate about something that a while ago would not have interested you in the slightest. It may be just a passing fad but it could also be the start of a brand new chapter in your life. If it inspires you, go for it.|06-14-2014|libra
192|You need to let certain individuals know that you and you alone will decide the course of your future. Far too many people seem to want a say in your affairs at the moment. Tell each and every one of them to mind their own business!|06-15-2014|libra
193|Make the most of the Sun’s last few days in your fellow Air sign of Gemini to do the things you really enjoy. When the Sun changes signs on the 21st you will find yourself snowed under with new responsibilities. Have fun while you can.|06-16-2014|libra
194|You are worrying about something that most other times would not bother you in the slightest – thanks to Mercury, planet of the mind, going through one of its negative phases. Snap out of it. Life is good and getting better by the moment.|06-17-2014|libra
195|Be generous with your time and, maybe, with your money too. You don’t have to give away all your worldly goods but the planets indicate that if you show kindness to someone in need now the favor will be returned many times over later on.|06-18-2014|libra
196|You are at a crossroads as far as a creative project is concerned. Do you carry on with it, although it’s a struggle, or do you give up and focus your energy in a new direction? Only you can decide, so give it some serious thought.|06-19-2014|libra
197|It’s good that you have the confidence to take risks but not so good if you take them wildly. As the Sun nears the career angle of your chart make sure you don’t do anything silly on the work front. Important people are watching.|06-20-2014|libra
198|It’s important that you have a long-term plan because if you are in two minds about what it is you should be aiming for you could waste both time and energy. On the work front, especially, have a goal and go for it with everything you’ve got.|06-21-2014|libra
199|The Sun in Cancer at this time of year is important for your career and for dealings with employers and other influential people. For that reason alone you must watch what you say and, above all, watch how you say it.|06-22-2014|libra
200|You will be in an adventurous mood over the next two or three days and that’s good because the planets suggest that if you go some place you have never been before you will meet someone who lights up your life. Yes, it could be love!|06-23-2014|libra
201|Not everyone will approve of what you get up to today but that won’t worry you one little bit. The planets will bring out the devil-may-care side of your nature over the next 24 hours. You will thoroughly enjoy shocking people.|06-24-2014|libra
202|Mars in your sign makes you believe you can do anything you choose but other aspects warn if you act without thinking today you could end up a serious loser. Stay on the good side of people in positions of power.|06-25-2014|libra
203|Tomorrow’s new moon will bring with it a golden opportunity to move up in the world, but it won’t come for free – you will have to give something of value in return. Is it a trade worth making? The fact is you cannot afford not to.|06-26-2014|libra
204|You can expect something big to happen on the work front over the next few days. But why wait for things to happen to you? Why not make them happen yourself? Show those in positions of power you are ready to be promoted.|06-27-2014|libra
205|No matter how many negative things may be going on around you be positive and believe you have been blessed with remarkable good fortune. Remember: the world you inhabit is a reflection of what goes on in your heart and your head.|06-28-2014|libra
206|Your imaginative powers will be on a high over the next seven days, so visualize what it is you most wish to accomplish and start taking the steps that can make it happen. Your mind is a more powerful tool than you realize.|06-29-2014|libra
207|Cosmic activity in your fellow Air sign of Gemini will do wonders for your confidence over the next 48 hours and it won’t be long before what you’ve been worrying about is consigned to the dustbin of history – where it belongs.|06-30-2014|libra
208|Mercury, planet of communication and the mind, has been moving retrograde in recent weeks, so not everything has worked out the way you expected it to. Never mind – as from today you will find your feet, and your head, again.|07-01-2014|libra
209|Listen to what your inner voice tells you today because not only is it good advice but it’s the kind of advice you won’t get from other people. The answers you seek are not “out there” in the world but hidden in the depths of your heart.|07-02-2014|libra
210|Travel and social plans may be disrupted today, so try not to make promises you won’t be able to keep. There is no point trying to look too far ahead. Concentrate on who and what is in front of you at this very moment.|07-03-2014|libra
211|You have allowed certain people to get away with things they did not deserve to get away with. Now you must balance things out and see to it that they pay for their mistakes. Next time, don’t let things get so out of hand.|07-04-2014|libra
212|This will be an emotional weekend for you and looking back a few days hence you may wonder why you overreacted in such spectacular fashion. Try not to be so sensitive to criticism, either at home or at work. Words can’t really hurt you.|07-05-2014|libra
213|Trust your instincts this week, even if they lead you in a different direction to everyone else. Actually you rather enjoy going against the flow and deep down you know it’s the right thing to do. Trust your inner voice.|07-06-2014|libra
214|The more nice things you say about others today the more nice things they will do for you in the near future. You will, of course, have to make your compliments sound sincere (especially if they’re not) but it’s an effort worth making.|07-07-2014|libra
215|You seem to be in a bit of a slump and things are unlikely to pick up until you admit that the old way of doing things may not be so good after all. You’re an ideas person, so think of ways to boost your productivity.|07-08-2014|libra
216|Others may tell you that your recent good fortune was pure luck but you know better. You are a Libra. You are special. More importantly you are the kind of person who is never satisfied with things as they are. Keep reaching. Keep achieving.|07-09-2014|libra
217|Someone in a position of authority clearly likes you but if you take that as a sign that you can do as you please you are sadly mistaken. Important people are looking to you to provide a lead, so don’t let them, or yourself, down.|07-10-2014|libra
218|You may be tempted to say something negative to a friend today but you are advised against it. Even if what you say is true and even if your motives are pure you not only won’t receive any thanks but you could cause a long-term split.|07-11-2014|libra
219|Because today’s full moon occurs in the area of your chart that governs your family life there will likely be a few emotional ups and downs on the home front. No matter what is said or done just forgive and forget and move on.|07-12-2014|libra
220|Over the next few days you will rediscover your talent for getting people working together as a team. As Libra is a cardinal sign you usually like to take the lead but on this occasion you will be content to be one among many.|07-13-2014|libra
221|You will be both assertive and adventurous over the next 24 hours and that’s good. If you believe in your abilities then anything and everything is possible for you. Employers and other important people will be impressed by your can-do attitude.|07-14-2014|libra
222|Your situation is not as bad as you think and what happens over the next seven days will prove it. Make a conscious effort to look on the bright side and keep telling yourself that, overall, you are very much on an upward course.|07-15-2014|libra
223|There is no point getting angry with those who have let you down. The more you shout at them the more likely it is they will make further mistakes. You need to change your attitude. A more forgiving outlook will work wonders.|07-16-2014|libra
224|Treat what happens over the next few days as an opportunity for advancement, personally and professionally. And treat people you meet as potential friends and allies. Show the world what a go-getter and trend-setter you can be – but nicely.|07-17-2014|libra
225|You need to decide which is more important to you: love or ambition. You can, of course, have both but if you are wise you will put personal happiness first and professional success second. People are more important than things.|07-18-2014|libra
226|You need to shake things up a bit. On the work front, especially, you seem to have fallen into a rut of late, so it’s time to inject a bit more energy and excitement into what has become, to be blunt, a lazy routine.|07-19-2014|libra
227|The planets in their courses are urging you to be a bit less suspicious than you usually are. They also suggest that even if you do lose out in some way it won’t be by much. In a nutshell: stop worrying and start living.|07-20-2014|libra
228|The planets warn that in some areas it might be wise to play safe and stick with what you know and trust. Creatively and romantically you have a lot to gain but also a lot to lose, so don’t go to extremes – find a workable middle way.|07-21-2014|libra
229|You will get the chance to show what you can do today and you must seize it and use it. If you allow such a golden opportunity to pass you by you may spend the remainder of the year kicking yourself mentally for being so wasteful.|07-22-2014|libra
230|Life is meant to be enjoyed and that is exactly what you will be doing over the next few days – enjoying yourself. Your can-do attitude will serve you very well indeed and others will be attracted by your positive vibes.|07-23-2014|libra
231|No one doubts you have talent but talent is only one part of the equation – the more important part by far is enthusiasm, and with Jupiter so strong in your chart at the moment you’ve got it coming out of your ears. Do something wonderful!|07-24-2014|libra
232|You have a tendency to believe in yourself to such a degree that you think nothing can ever go wrong – which is great – but you also need to recognize that everyone has limits. Mercury will point out a few of them to you today.|07-25-2014|libra
233|Things may not be working out exactly as you hoped they would but there is no need to change direction. Cosmic activity in one of the better areas of your chart this weekend will put everything right and you’ll soon be smiling again.|07-26-2014|libra
234|Sometimes you need subtlety and strategy as well as strength and what happens over the next few days will remind you of that fact. To put it simply: to get what you desire you will have to make sure others get what they desire too.|07-27-2014|libra
235|If what you are working on refuses to conform to your expectations maybe you should draw a line under it and go back to basics. Most importantly, you need to accept that it doesn’t help in any way to set yourself such difficult targets.|07-28-2014|libra
236|Have faith in your own ideas and don’t be afraid to take a calculated risk. Deep down you know you are on the right track and that what you are working on is meaningful, so keep going and don’t ever waste time looking back.|07-29-2014|libra
237|Everything that occurs in your life is part of a wider and deeper plan, so don’t try too hard to change things because it’s unlikely to happen. Sit back and let fate take its course – and success and happiness are sure to follow.|07-30-2014|libra
238|As a cardinal sign winning is important to you but sometimes you take it too far and expect too much of yourself. What happens today will remind you how good the simple things in life can be, none of which require you to be the best.|07-31-2014|libra
239|If you try to force others to follow your lead today they will refuse. If, however, you use your charm to win them over you will find it quite easy to maneuver them in the direction you want them to go. You’re a major persuader!|08-01-2014|libra
240|This is an especially good time for social activities but you fear you won’t find the time to do what makes you happiest. Just because your In tray is piled high does not mean you can’t have fun. Give yourself a day or two off.|08-02-2014|libra
241|There is a danger now that you could push yourself too hard and put your wellbeing at risk. There is a simple rule you must follow to make sure you stay fit and healthy: Don’t go to extremes. Libra is the sign of balance – remember?|08-03-2014|libra
242|The more others try to persuade you that now is not the time to try something different the more confident you can be that it’s exactly the right time. You like taking chances and you’re good at it too. Be a pioneer. Discover something new.|08-04-2014|libra
243|Do something out of the ordinary today, something others would not expect of you. If your instincts tell you to go for something you must not hesitate for even a moment. There is glory at stake and you must not let it pass you by.|08-05-2014|libra
244|You expect great things of yourself, which is good, but sometimes you go too far and set yourself targets that are impossible to reach. What happens over the next few days will bring you back to earth with a bump – and a bruise or two to your ego.|08-06-2014|libra
245|You may be surprised that someone you know socially is prepared to put your interests ahead of their own but you should not be. For quite some time they have been trying to tell you that they think of you as more than just a friend!|08-07-2014|libra
246|The planets will bring you into contact with people who share your ideals. They will also boost your belief that you can make a difference in the world and that working with others you can change things for the better. But don’t get fanatical about it.|08-08-2014|libra
247|There is no point discussing what you want to do with family and friends because they are sure to try to make you change your mind. You should be confident enough to move ahead on your own initiative. Do what feels right to you.|08-09-2014|libra
248|The more you try to tell others what they should be doing this week the more they will resist and before you know it you could have a rebellion on your hands. Just accept that the full moon makes some people touchy and unmanageable.|08-10-2014|libra
249|Over the next few days you will find it easy to put your thoughts into words – and even easier to deliver those words with considerable force. You are not in the mood to pussyfoot around just to protect other people’s feelings.|08-11-2014|libra
250|You need to take life at a more relaxed pace over the next 24 hours. You will have to deal with important issues, of course, but it is how you deal with them that makes all the difference. Seriously, there is nothing to worry about.|08-12-2014|libra
251|You are unlikely to be tactful when dealing with people whose views and opinions you disagree with but that’s okay because you are as entitled to your viewpoint as they are to theirs. Give as good as you get over the next 24 hours.|08-13-2014|libra
252|The planets suggest you are thinking about buying something costly. It’s your money and you can do what you want with it but is it something you need or is it an impulse purchase? Think about it before you hand over your credit card.|08-14-2014|libra
253|You will have to make a conscious effort over the next 24 hours not to let your fears get the better of you. Whatever it is you are worried about it is almost certainly an illusion. Put it out of your mind – and out of your life.|08-15-2014|libra
254|Steer clear of people who always seem to take a negative view of life. There will always be those who think the world is falling apart but you know the world has rarely been in better shape – and you’re in pretty good shape too!|08-16-2014|libra
255|Yes, a rival has been saying things about you behind your back, but there is no need for you to get uptight about it. How can they hurt you? The short answer is they can’t. You hold all the right cards – and are loved by all the right people.|08-17-2014|libra
256|Try not to see conspiracies where none exist. There may indeed be one or two things going on that seem a bit suspicious but people are not talking behind your back – and if they are it’s because they are planning a surprise treat for you.|08-18-2014|libra
257|With Mars, planet of action, moving through one of the more materialistic areas of your chart you will jump at the chance to move up in the world over the next few days. Just make sure what you do benefits you, not other people.|08-19-2014|libra
258|Don’t try to stop a friend or relative from doing something you do not approve of. Most likely it will make them even more determined to do it, just to annoy you. The only person you should be concerned with is yourself.|08-20-2014|libra
259|The planets warn you need to accept the fact that you won’t be able to do everything, no matter how carefully you manage your time. Either cut back on your ambitions or get help. Of course, if you are really sensible you will do both.|08-21-2014|libra
260|The Sun’s change of signs will lead to a mellowing in your mood and that’s probably no bad thing as you have been a bit hyper of late. If you take nothing too seriously over the next 48 hours you won’t suffer any serious damage.|08-23-2014|libra
261|Your confidence may be a bit fragile at the moment but that is no reason to curtail your ambitions. On the contrary, tomorrow’s new moon will encourage you to think of new ways you can cash in on your talents. Be bold!|08-24-2014|libra
262||08-26-2014|libra
263|A negative feeling has been nagging at you these past few days and you can’t seem to shift it. What you need to understand and accept is that you are not responsible for the bad things that go on in the world. Focus on good things only.|08-27-2014|libra
264|You will make your point more effectively today if you stay calm and back up your arguments with facts that can’t be denied. Others can rant and rave if they like but it won’t convince anyone. Your serene demeanor will make you look good.|08-28-2014|libra
265|Don’t expect too much of other people today because they will be inclined to say one thing while doing something completely different. There is nothing much you can do about other people’s attitudes and actions, so take it all in your stride.|08-29-2014|libra
266|It would appear that someone thinks you are an easy touch. Are they correct? The moon’s eclipse of Saturn this weekend warns you need to be careful when dealing with money. Make sure you know where your cash is at all times.|08-30-2014|libra
267|You may be good at juggling several tasks at once but now you’re beginning to show signs of strain. The planets urge you to cut back on your commitments and focus on the one thing that merits your attention. You know what it is. |08-31-2014|libra
268|Do something out of the ordinary today, something that makes those around you sit up and take notice. It doesn’t have to be anything outrageous, just something that reminds others you are special. Maybe you need to remind yourself as well.|09-01-2014|libra
269|Mercury, planet of the mind, moves into your birth sign today, so you will know instantly what needs to be done. But it does not mean you have to do it straight away. If you get a great idea sleep on it for a while.|09-02-2014|libra
270|You will do best today if you make a conscious effort to shut out the world and create a mental and emotional bubble inside which everything is peaceful and calm. You don’t have to be a party animal every day of the week.|09-03-2014|libra
271|At some stage today you will realize how hard it can be to understand certain people – they just won’t fit into the neat little boxes your mind has constructed. Take the hint and accept that people, like life in general, can be messy.|09-04-2014|libra
272|You want to move up in the world, of course, but try not to be too pushy over the next 48 hours or you could undo a lot of the good work you have done in recent weeks. You will be judged mainly on how you help others.|09-05-2014|libra
273|If someone you approach for assistance this weekend gives you a less than positive response, don’t worry about it and certainly don’t feel sorry for yourself. According to the planets you don’t need anyone’s help – you just need to believe in yourself.|09-06-2014|libra
274|You need to let go of feelings and habits which belong to the past. You crave balance and stability but, perversely, you will only find them when you stop looking so hard. Also, there are some things you no longer need – get rid of them.|09-07-2014|libra
275|Don’t listen to people who say you should do something one way when every instinct you have tells you that it should be done another way. Trust your own inner voice, not the voices of know-it-alls who really know nothing.|09-08-2014|libra
276|Sheer force of personality will see you past whatever obstacles block your path over the next 24 hours. You are in no mood to take prisoners and anyone foolish enough to take you on is likely to regret it. Try not to be brutal.|09-09-2014|libra
277|Someone will try to undermine your confidence today but they won’t succeed. You know who you are and you know what you are worth and their words won’t change that in any way. It may change the way you think about them though.|09-10-2014|libra
278|The most important thing today is that you communicate what you have to say in plain and simple language. Not everyone possesses your way with words, so make sure all can understand you. It’s important that you make yourself heard.|09-11-2014|libra
279|No matter how ambitious a Libra you may be there are more important things in life than material success, and today you will be reminded what they are. Relationships, friendships and travel plans are all well starred over the next 24 hours.|09-12-2014|libra
280|You may have to say something harsh to someone you love today but in the long-term your words will have the desired effect. A minor confrontation now is preferable to a major one later on, so speak up and get your message across.|09-13-2014|libra
281|It would appear that a colleague cares only about what they want and could not care less what you want. In which case why are you still working alongside them? The world is full of possibilities, so break free and make your own future.|09-14-2014|libra
282|Try not to criticize yourself for no good reason. In fact, try not to criticize yourself even if there is a good reason. If you made a mistake of some kind then learn from it quickly and move on. Today’s failure can be tomorrow’s success.|09-15-2014|libra
283|Something you thought was a permanent part of your world will disappear today but there is no need to feel sad about it. On the contrary, by creating a space in your life you will encourage something even better to come in and fill it.|09-16-2014|libra
284|Mercury, the planet of the mind, in your sign makes this the ideal time to get your head around what you need to change to make your life more complete. You must be practical though – don’t let idle daydreams lead you astray.|09-17-2014|libra
285|Whether or not you have the necessary experience to take on a new role on the work front is irrelevant – what matters is that you have the intelligence and the ambition. The best way to get ahead is to stop worrying and just go for it.|09-18-2014|libra
286|There is no reason why you should beat yourself up about something that went wrong. If you indulge your emotions too much you may lose sight of all the good things you have to be thankful for. Make a list of them today.|09-19-2014|libra
287|You will meet a deadline by the skin of your teeth this weekend. You could, of course, finish it in half the time and with half the effort too if you were to draw up a plan and stick to it, but where’s the fun in that?|09-20-2014|libra
288|When the Sun moves into your birth sign on Tuesday you will get a new lease of life. Before then, however, it might be a good idea to review the successes and failures of the past few months. Most importantly, what can you learn about yourself?|09-21-2014|libra
289|Is it in your interests to follow a certain course of action? Do you even know what your interests are? Your mind may be a bit confused today but tomorrow, when the Sun moves into your birth sign, all will be clear, so leave it for 24 hours.|09-22-2014|libra
290|You are determined to put right what you feel has gone wrong with your life and with the Sun moving into your birth sign today you can sense that the time to act has arrived. Indeed it has, especially as there is a new moon tomorrow.|09-23-2014|libra
291|A new moon on your birthday means you no longer need to keep a low profile. No doubt you’ve done well for yourself in various supporting roles but now you must push your way to the front of the stage and take over. It’s your life and your show.|09-24-2014|libra
292|You may seem calm and confident on the outside but deep down you fear the worst. The good news is that whatever it is that has got you so worried will be out of your life by the end of the day. So lighten up.|09-25-2014|libra
293|Positive developments in your social life may have the edge taken off them by bad news concerning your finances today, but don’t sweat it. Mercury’s move into the money area of your chart tomorrow will bring an obvious answer.|09-26-2014|libra
294|If you let the universe know what you want over the coming 12 months the universe will give it to you with no questions asked. If you can think it you can do it. If you can imagine it you can make it a reality. Put a name to your dreams and watch them come true.|09-27-2014|libra
295|Whatever triumphs or disasters you face over this year one thing is certain: you’ll love every moment of it. There is something in the Libra outlook that sees life as a enjoyable challenge and, win or lose, you are determined to have fun. Others will follow your example.|09-28-2014|libra
296|There has been a great deal of tension in your life of late but with Venus, your ruler, moving into your sign today you can expect things to be a bit more relaxed. The secret, of course, is to not take life quite so seriously.|09-29-2014|libra
297|You know what needs to be done to improve a relationship – so get on and do it. A week or so from now a lunar eclipse in your opposite sign will challenge both of you, so make sure the bonds of love are strong.|09-30-2014|libra
298|Whatever challenges you are faced with today you should be able to find ways to deal with them. Even if they prove tougher than expected there is sure to be someone you can turn to for assistance and advice. All you have to do is ask.|10-01-2014|libra
299|There is an easy way and a hard way to get to your destination. The easy way is to co-operate with people you don’t always get along with. The hard way is to try to do everything yourself. Either way, you will get there in the end.|10-02-2014|libra
300|The most important thing on your birthday is that you are honest with yourself about who you are and where you are trying to go. Whatever your current position you can improve on it, but you must be clear of thought and decisive in action.|10-03-2014|libra
301|If you think big and act big then, inevitably, there will be occasions when you make big mistakes as well. No doubt you will make plenty of them over the coming 12 months but you will also enjoy successes that are not just big but huge.|10-04-2014|libra
302|According to the planets you may be feeling a bit sorry for yourself at the moment. You need to snap out of it because there are all sorts of great opportunities heading your way and if you are drowning in tears you may miss them.|10-05-2014|libra
303|The planets urge you to let go of something that is holding you back from being the best that you can be. It may be a belief, it may be an attitude, it may be a relationship, but whatever it is you’ve got to leave it behind – not later, but now.|10-06-2014|libra
304|Keep affairs of the heart on a fun level today, because the more you try to force a relationship in a certain direction the more the one you love will feel pressured, and that’s not good. The subtle approach is by far the best approach.|10-07-2014|libra
305|Not only is there a lunar eclipse on your birthday this year but Mars and Jupiter are strong too, so the next 12 months will see challenges aplenty. Be bold, be brave and, above all, be the kind of Libra who always finds something to be happy about.|10-08-2014|libra
306|In your mind’s eye you have an image of the person you think you should be, but is it a realistic image? The message of your birthday chart is that you need to stop setting yourself impossible targets and find ways to just enjoy who you already are.|10-09-2014|libra
307|Today and over the weekend you need to either throw yourself into a serious project or leave it completely alone and go off and do something purely for fun. It must be one or the other: if you try to do both you’ll get nowhere.|10-10-2014|libra
308|Someone you are close to emotionally seems to be in a strange frame of mind at the moment but there is no reason why you should be worried about it. Come the start of next week they will be back to who and what they were before.|10-11-2014|libra
309|You are torn between two entirely different ways of approaching the coming year. Do you go all out for glory and let other people look out for themselves? Or do you put helping those less fortune than you front and center? It must be the latter. |10-12-2014|libra
310|You must not trust in shortcuts today, not even those you have used many times before. The planets demand that everything is done by the book over the next 24 hours, even if you know how to complete a task in half the time.|10-13-2014|libra
311|A Venus-Jupiter link on your birthday means the coming year will see you making new friendships, new alliances and, maybe, a new romantic attachment too. The more open you are about your feelings the more you will get out of life. Get plenty!|10-14-2014|libra
312|Do you have something to say? Is there a message you want to give to the world? Of course there is and with the Sun and Mars strong on your birthday you will make sure everyone knows what it is. You’ll make a huge difference over the coming 12 months.|10-15-2014|libra
313|You know what you want and you know how to get it but with mind planet Mercury still moving retrograde can you be absolutely certain you have made the right call? Give it a day or two before making a final decision. What’s the rush?|10-16-2014|libra
314|Mercury and Venus join forces on your birthday, making it easy for you to breeze through life without a care. There is, however, a world of difference between not having a care and actually not caring. Watch out you don’t lose the human touch.|10-17-2014|libra
315|Venus and Mars, the relationships planets, join forces on your birthday, promising fun days and passionate nights. It’s not what you do for a living or how much you earn that matters, but what positive impressions you make on a one-to-one level.|10-19-2014|libra
316|Friendships are under excellent stars for the coming 12 months but because Mercury is moving retrograde on your birthday you need to be selective about who you spend your time with. Get to know people who challenge you to think deeply about life.|10-20-2014|libra
317|You can continue to deny you have a problem if you like but that won’t make it go away. The planets urge you to face up to what needs to be changed in your life. Be brave, be positive and be the kind of Libra who is always looking to improve.|10-21-2014|libra
318|The most important thing over the next 12 months is that you consciously focus on what is positive in your life and put what is negative out of your mind. Strive to be a force for good in the world and the world will be good to you in return.|10-22-2014|libra
319|Your mind is full of big ideas but are you able to turn them into some kind of new reality? Now is the time to find out as the planets urge you to make an extra special effort – from which you can expect an extra special reward.|10-23-2014|libra
320|Don’t let problems of a financial nature dent your confidence. The Sun in Scorpio over the next few weeks will bring new possibilities and all you really need to do is keep your eyes and ears open. You’re better off than you think you are.|10-24-2014|libra
321|You have bent over backwards in recent weeks to accommodate other people’s wishes but now you can see it did no good at all. If others won’t give you what you so clearly deserve this weekend then you must seize it for yourself.|10-25-2014|libra
322|You need to get your priorities right and you need to understand that obsessing over petty issues is a total waste of time and energy. There are things that you would like to do and things that you have to do. Do only the latter this week.|10-26-2014|libra
323|Put other people’s needs first over the next 24 hours. A good deed done today will come back to you several times over before the end of the year. The universe always rewards those who seek to lighten the load of their fellow man.|10-27-2014|libra
324|Libra is the sign of the balance and over the next 24 hours you must find ways to balance your head and your heart. Something may sound logical and reasonable but if your inner voice urges you to be cautious don’t you dare ignore it.|10-28-2014|libra
325|You will be sensitive to other people’s moods today – so sensitive, in fact, that you may prefer to be by yourself for a while. That’s okay. You don’t have to be the life and soul of the party, especially when the other guests are so dull!|10-29-2014|libra
326|Fix your attention on a situation and learn as much about it as you can. According to the planets the more you know about what is going on the better placed you will be to benefit from coming upheavals, which won’t be long in arriving.|10-30-2014|libra
327|You may need to shut yourself off from the world this weekend, if only so you have the time and the space to remind yourself what it is you are aiming for in this life. Listen to your inner voice, then act on what it tells you.|11-01-2014|libra
328|A problem that once gave you sleepless nights now seems to have disappeared, but don’t be fooled. It has merely gone into hiding and will make a reappearance around the time of Thursday’s full moon. Be ready for it and, this time, deal with it.|11-02-2014|libra
329|A challenge of some kind will push you beyond the rather narrow limits you have imposed upon yourself in recent weeks. Don’t worry that you may not be up to the task – you will find hidden reserves of talent and energy. |11-03-2014|libra
330|You may be in a position to help a friend resolve a dispute of some kind but unless they directly ask you to get involved you are strongly advised to keep your distance. This is a problem they can and should face up to by themselves.|11-04-2014|libra
331|Today’s Sun-Uranus link warns that changing things for the sake of it is both foolish and dangerous. If something isn’t broken then why try to fix it? Your motto for the day should be to leave things alone, both at home and at work. |11-05-2014|libra
332|You are always ready to help other people out but that does not mean they should take your good nature for granted. Maybe it’s time to drop the nice guy act and start getting tough with those who are using you for their own ends.|11-06-2014|libra
333|Different people have different histories and different personalities and therefore see things in different ways. They also have different ideas of what is right and what is wrong. You need to understand that, and act accordingly, over the next 24 hours.|11-07-2014|libra
334|Routine matters must not be left to other people today, not if you want a good job made of them. Certain responsibilities may be tiresome and take up an excessive amount of your time but they have to be done, so get cracking.|11-08-2014|libra
335|Don’t take risks with money this week as the planets warn you could quite easily mislead yourself into thinking that your financial position is stronger than it actually is. Keep your cash in your pocket.|11-09-2014|libra
336|No matter how hard you try to control your feelings today Mars and Pluto will make it extremely difficult not to get angry about something. On this occasion you are probably right to blow your top, so say your piece – loudly – and get it over with.|11-10-2014|libra
337|According to the planets you may have gone too far in your criticisms of a friend or work colleague and at some stage today you will have to backtrack a bit. But only a bit. The essence of your complaint still holds true. |11-11-2014|libra
338|The answer to a problem of some kind will become crystal clear today. It was there all the time, of course, only you were unable to see it. You may have to pay out more than you expected but it’s worth it if it sets you free.|11-12-2014|libra
339|Positive thoughts will bring positive results today. Even a financial problem you have been struggling with for weeks or months can be resolved, especially if you are prepared to listen to the advice of an older and wiser colleague.|11-13-2014|libra
340|What you are given today may not be what you wanted but if you accept it in the right spirit it will lead to something better. Likewise, when it is you who is doing the giving, listen to your head as well as your heart. |11-14-2014|libra
341|Your life is changing for the better and what happens this weekend will confirm that fact. Even when things go wrong you will take them in your stride and find something to smile about. And that’s the key: strive only to be happy. |11-15-2014|libra
342|You will be snowed under with offers to make a name for yourself over the next seven days. For best results, keep your options open. You don’t have to make a final decision just yet, so play hard to get. Let others chase after you.|11-16-2014|libra
343|Don’t listen to those who say you must follow the “official” line on something. The more they try to make sure you conform to their rules the more convinced you should be that their rules are wrong. Trust your own moral compass. |11-17-2014|libra
344|As one of the zodiac’s cardinal signs you can be amazingly forceful at times and because there is something you desire you won’t hesitate to be assertive today. Be sensible though – know when it is wise to hold back.|11-18-2014|libra
345|The planets indicate you are destined to offend someone over the next 24 hours, no matter which course of action you choose to take. So, whatever it is you are planning, do it quickly, do it well and get it over with.|11-19-2014|libra
346|Affairs of the heart are, of course, important but as relationship planet Venus squares up to Neptune, planet of illusion, today you are advised not to take them too seriously. You may not be able to love but you can still have a good laugh. |11-20-2014|libra
347|You appear to have missed a chance to improve your money situation and now you are wishing you had been more adventurous. Be that as it may you were right not to take chances. Even better opportunities won’t be long in coming.|11-21-2014|libra
348|Everything you say over the next 48 hours will come out the way you mean it and everything you do will work out the way you intended. This will be a good weekend by any standards but with luck could be out of this world. |11-22-2014|libra
349|You seem to be in a much more relaxed frame of mind now that the Sun has moved into the most outgoing are of your chart. Money worries may not be behind you entirely but they certainly won’t stop you having fun.|11-23-2014|libra
350|There may be certain patterns of behavior that you would like to overcome but you have got to be sensible about it. You can’t change overnight, nor can you just give things up. Think long-term and replace bad habits with good habits. |11-24-2014|libra
351|Feelings you thought you had outgrown or left behind will make a return over the next two or three days but they are nothing to worry about. Remember though that you cannot turn the clock back, no matter how strong your feelings may be.  |11-25-2014|libra
352|A dream you’ve had for years is about to become a reality. It may not come about in the precise way you expected but that doesn’t matter – the important thing is that you recognize how fortunate you are and make the most of the opportunity.|11-26-2014|libra
353|Even if you are happy with the way life is going it will pay you to try something different today. A new routine may seem a little odd to begin with but once you get used to it you will wonder why you did not change sooner.|11-27-2014|libra
354|Someone will say something today that is extremely flattering, but don’t let it go to your head. The praise may be thoroughly deserved but if you allow your pride to grow it may get in the way of seeing what still needs to be done.|11-28-2014|libra
355|If you feel the need to escape from duties and obligations then now is the time. The Sun in Sagittarius makes it easy for you to take a short break but no one will give it to you, so get up and go and come back on Monday refreshed.|11-29-2014|libra
356|The planets warn this may not be the best of times to back your hunches – not because they are wrong necessarily but because you will have better options to choose from later in the week. You will sense when the moment is right.|11-30-2014|libra
357|Something is missing from your life and you won’t be happy until you find out what it is. According to the planets it is not something “out there” in the world but something “in here” in your heart. Change your outlook and your life will change too.  |12-01-2014|libra
358|You may be wondering if you would be better off in a different place with a different group of people. Maybe you would, but don’t make any hasty decisions. The full moon at the weekend will point you in the right direction. |12-02-2014|libra
359|If you hope for the best today you will surely get it. What you need to realize is that you always attract into your life the kind of luck you think you deserve. You deserve the best, so expect it and it will be given to you.|12-03-2014|libra
360|Employers and people in positions of authority will flatter you shamelessly today. Are they after something? Of course they are! The fact is you are in a great position and have every right to use it to get a better deal for yourself.|12-04-2014|libra
361|Today’s full moon is sure to cause some tension, but because it falls in your fellow Air sign of Gemini you should be able to handle it. Remember too that the best way to handle people who annoy you is simply to ignore them.|12-06-2014|libra
362|An instant response may not be the best response over the next few days, so take your time and make sure you communicate your true feelings. Remember too that you are always loved, no matter how difficult a particular day may be.|12-07-2014|libra
363|If you make an effort to get to know someone you previously thought of as boring you may be surprised to find they are more interesting than you imagine. They say you can’t judge a book by its cover and in this case that may be true. |12-08-2014|libra
364|You will hear something today that sounds too good to be true and you are right to be suspicious because what you are being told is only half the story. Listen to your inner voice – it knows the difference between fact and fiction. |12-09-2014|libra
365|Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart could make you more emotional than usual but maybe that’s no bad thing. Let loved ones know that you still care for them, even though your life seems to revolve around work at the moment.|12-10-2014|libra
366|Some of the people you meet today and tomorrow could be very important to you professionally or financially in the future, so be on your best behavior and dress to impress. You know how to flirt, don’t you? That will help too!|12-11-2014|libra
367|If you find it hard to make up your mind about what you should be doing today then ask someone you trust. Even if you disagree with them and do the exact opposite of what they suggest you will at least be doing something.|12-12-2014|libra
368|Forget about details and other petty distractions over the next 48 hours. Focus on the big picture and let others worry about the small stuff. Despite what some people might say you don’t have to be in control of each and every situation.|12-13-2014|libra
369|If a loved one insists on having their own way over something trivial it might be wise to play along and at least pretend you agree with them. If it earns you the space you need to get more important things done then it’s a sacrifice worth making.|12-14-2014|libra
370|You will be in a confident mood today but because you think you can get away with anything you might try something you know is forbidden. It may work out okay in the short-term but in the long-term you will certainly regret it.|12-15-2014|libra
371|You don’t have to explain your motives or your actions to anyone. If someone demands to know what you are doing just tell them to mind their own business. The atmosphere may be tense for a while but they’ll get the message. |12-16-2014|libra
372|Be wary of those who offer you something for nothing today. They may not want any kind of payment for it now but it will give them lots of leverage later on when they want something from you. Don’t be fooled. |12-17-2014|libra
373|There may be all sorts of exciting things going on in your social environment but you must ignore them all and focus on getting a family matter sorted. Let loved ones know it’s time to draw a line under a long-running feud. |12-18-2014|libra
374|If you go after your target too directly or too forcefully today you may find that it eludes you. You’ve got to be subtle in your approach, you’ve got to bide your time and wait for exactly the right moment. It won’t be long in coming.|12-19-2014|libra
375|Honesty is always the best policy even though it does not always go down well with those you are being honest about! It’s not your fault if others get upset with what you have to say this weekend – it’s their fault for making mistakes.|12-20-2014|libra
376|Force yourself to be positive about what you have to do during the early part of the week. There may be a dozen more interesting things you would rather be doing but duty comes first even though it’s the holiday season.|12-21-2014|libra
377|A personal issue that has been causing you problems will take a turn for the better, though it may take a few days to get going. The most important thing is that you don’t try to hang on to what is now moving out of your life.|12-22-2014|libra
378|Don’t worry too much if others go out of their way to poke holes in your plans today – they just want to make sure you know what you are doing. You don’t need anyone’s permission to follow your dreams. Go it alone if you have to. |12-23-2014|libra
379|Make time for family members today and make sure they know how much you love them. Too often you take it for granted that they know what’s in your heart but it won’t hurt to be a bit more emotionally expressive.|12-24-2014|libra
380|You may not like it that rivals have the upper hand at the moment but appearances can be deceptive and before the day is over you will have won back your favored status. The simple fact is you are tougher than they are – and smarter too. |12-25-2014|libra
381|If you try to help someone out today but they reject your advances don’t take it personally. Most likely they are under so much pressure at the moment that they cannot think straight. They will ask you for help sooner or later. |12-26-2014|libra
382|Go out of your way to be nice to friends and family over the next 48 hours. Not that you are not nice to them usually but this weekend you will get the chance to overcome differences and difficulties once and for all. It’s worth the effort.|12-27-2014|libra
383|Aim for quality rather than quantity over the next few days. It’s good to be enthusiastic but if you take on too much as you go into the new year you will struggle later when, inevitably, your motivation begins to wane. Pace yourself.|12-28-2014|libra
384|Try not to dwell on negative news. The planets warn you are taking a situation far too seriously, certainly more seriously than anyone else is taking it. If it does not bother the people it most affects then why should it bother you?|12-29-2014|libra
385|It may be a bit quiet for your tastes at the moment but don’t worry because things will speed up and heat up considerably towards the end of the week. Between now and then get plenty of rest – chances are you are going to need it.|12-30-2014|libra
386|Be careful when listening to what other people tell you, because they may not be telling you the whole truth. You may be in a party mood at the moment but that does not mean you can throw caution to the wind. |12-31-2014|libra
387|Jupiter, planet of expansion, will bring a change of fortunes early in the new year, and a lot more fun as well. Ring in 2015 in the company of friends and expect to be showered with good things over the next few days. |01-01-2015|libra
388|Some kind of upheaval is likely over the next 24 hours but it need not be as bad as it sounds. In fact it could be quite beneficial, especially if you are one of those Librans who find it hard to express their feelings. |01-02-2015|libra
389|Venus, the planet of love, moves into one of the best areas of your chart this weekend. Everyone knows you can be assertive but how many know you can be romantic too? Someone fortunate person is about to find out! |01-03-2015|libra
390|Focus on affairs of the heart and don’t worry too much about what’s going in your work or career. Monday’s full moon is sure to have some of your colleagues acting strangely but it won’t last, so don’t be offended. |01-04-2015|libra
391|There are so many changes taking place now that you may feel a bit insecure. That is entirely natural and certainly not an excuse to start feeling sorry for yourself. Libra is a cardinal sign, so step up and show your leadership qualities. |01-05-2015|libra
392|What is right for other people won’t necessarily be right for you today, so don’t follow their example just because you think it is expected of you. Libra is an Air sign, which means you have a mind of your own. Don’t forget to use it. |01-06-2015|libra
393|Someone you don’t always get along with will be unusually friendly towards you today and you are right to be a bit suspicious. According to the planets they are up to no good, so be on your guard at all times. |01-07-2015|libra
394|Whatever disagreements or differences of opinion you may have had with friends or family members in recent weeks you can quite easily iron them out now. Make the first move and let it be known you don’t hold a grudge. |01-08-2015|libra
395|Everyone has limits, even a Libra, and if you stay within them nothing much will go wrong today. But if you get the idea that you can do anything you like, then you could make a fool of yourself – and you hate being laughed at. |01-09-2015|libra
396|Anyone who tries to tie you down to one place and one activity over the next 48 hours is doomed to fail. You are determined to move about a bit and see new places and meet new people. Anyone who tries to stop you is a bore.|01-10-2015|libra
397|You will have to work on something that does not interest you much this week but make a good job of it anyway. Important people are watching and if they like what they see you will get more interesting jobs in the future. |01-11-2015|libra
398|The tougher the challenge the more you like it and that’s just as well because the planets indicate you will be put to the test over the next few days. Just make sure you don’t take on too much. Know your limits and respect them.|01-12-2015|libra
399|What happens today may surprise you but with your ruler Venus on good terms with Uranus, planet of disruption, it will also change your life in interesting ways. Don’t hold on so tightly to the past – the future is where it’s at. |01-13-2015|libra
400|Everything seems to be going so well at the moment that you may get a bit suspicious and start wondering if it’s all too good to be true. On the contrary, colleagues and relatives will do anything for you, so enjoy it. |01-14-2015|libra
401|You will have to do something you don’t want to do today and most likely you will let everyone know – loudly – that it’s not your idea of fun. But you will do it anyway because you have your reputation to think of. Be professional.|01-15-2015|libra
402|You will be less inclined to worry about your cashflow situation today and over the weekend and that’s good. The only danger is you could go from one extreme to the other and start spending money like it grows on trees. It doesn’t. |01-16-2015|libra
403|The Sun in Capricorn at this time of year makes it a complete waste of time arguing with people, both at home and at work. No matter how sure you are of the facts they are simply too stubborn to recognize the truth. |01-17-2015|libra
404|Some way, some how you will make a big improvement in both your personal affairs and your working environment over the next few days. But if you really want to change things you must first change your attitude. Be positive. |01-18-2015|libra
405|You need to get the balance right between being assertive and being passive. Cosmic activity in your fellow Air sign of Aquarius will see to it that the right opportunity arrives at the right time – and you must react to it in the right way.|01-19-2015|libra
406|You can change a number of things over the next few days but if you really want a better day-to-day experience you must change your attitude. The way you see the world determines what kind of world it is going to be.|01-20-2015|libra
407|A friend may want you to join them in some sort of social event today but don’t force yourself if you don’t feel up to it. Cosmic activity in the wellbeing area of your chart means you need rest and relaxation, not more stimulation. |01-21-2015|libra
408|If you restrict yourself to one way of completing a task you will get bored and either make a poor job of it or give up on it altogether. Keep yourself interested by varying your routine and setting yourself challenging targets|01-22-2015|libra
409|Give a friend or family member the benefit of the doubt today, even if you suspect they are telling you lies. According to your solar chart you won’t lose out financially or emotionally, so why make an issue of it?|01-23-2015|libra
410|Others may be striving to get ahead this weekend but your aims are more humble: you will be happy to get through the next 48 hours unscathed. For best results, don’t take life too seriously – treat it all as a bit of a game.|01-24-2015|libra
411|Let loved ones know how much they mean to you and let them know you will always be there for them. Also, don’t use work as an excuse for not being able to spend quality time at home. You’re doing too much already. |01-25-2015|libra
412|Your logic circuits don’t seem to be functioning as they should at the moment, most likely because mind planet Mercury is in one of its retrograde phases. If in doubt, listen to what your inner voice is trying to tell you. |01-26-2015|libra
413|Venus, your ruler, moves into the wellbeing area of your chart today, making this the ideal time to take stock of your health and your fitness and decide what changes need to be made. They won’t have to be too drastic.|01-27-2015|libra
414|You may not be entirely enthusiastic about what you are expected to do today but if you are smart you will do it anyway and do it well. Others look up to you as someone who can be relied on. Don’t disappoint them. |01-28-2015|libra
415|Because the Sun is moving through the most creative and dynamic area of your chart you won’t find it hard to start something special. Don’t listen to those who tell you to limit your ambitions, listen to your instincts – and follow them. |01-29-2015|libra
416|One way or another you will soon be moving up in the world, which is good news for you but bad news for your rivals who will be moving down. Don’t waste time feeling sorry for them. Would they feel sorry for you if the roles were reversed?|01-30-2015|libra
417|Venus, your ruler, links with Neptune this weekend, so it might be wise to keep a low profile and conserve your energy, especially on the work front. Next week could be challenging, so save your best stuff for when it matters. |01-31-2015|libra
418|You can ask almost anything of almost anyone this coming week and chances are you will get it. Cosmic activity in your fellow Air sign of Aquarius makes you even more persuasive than usual – don’t let that talent go to waste.|02-01-2015|libra
419|Anyone who thinks they know you will be mightily surprised today as you do the opposite of what they predicted. Whether you do it for fun or whether you do it for a reason, they won’t take you for granted in a hurry again. |02-02-2015|libra
420|Today’s full moon may bring a sense of urgency to your tasks but you still need to plan carefully or you could make a serious mistake. You don’t want to upset someone whose support could be crucial to your long-term success.|02-03-2015|libra
421|If you start something new today you must expect it to take up a lot more time and energy than you expected. But in a way that’s good because it means you will have less time and energy to waste on trivial things.|02-04-2015|libra
422|You are on the verge of giving up on something that you just can’t seem to crack. What you don’t realize is that you are closer to a breakthrough than you have ever been before. Hold on a little longer – you’re almost there. |02-05-2015|libra
423|Your principles may cost you money today but you are not the sort to abandon your standards for financial reward. More to the point, you are not the sort to admit you got it wrong once you have adopted a certain position! |02-06-2015|libra
424|Try not to get uptight if you come across someone whose lifestyle and beliefs you disapprove of this weekend. If they really offend you that much just stay out of their way. Alternatively, try getting to know what they’re really like.|02-07-2015|libra
425|There are so many interesting things going on in your world at the moment that it would be a crime to waste time wondering what others are playing at. Don’t think about them, think about yourself and what you are hoping to achieve. |02-08-2015|libra
426|Tell the truth as you see it. There will be a lot of noise and confusion over the next few days and much of it will be designed to lead you away from what is really going on – but you are not so easily fooled. |02-09-2015|libra
427|Don’t blame yourself unduly for some kind of mistake – either it wasn’t your fault at all or it was the kind of thing that can happen to anyone at any time. You never claimed to be perfect, so others cannot demand it of you.|02-10-2015|libra
428|Your latest project will be a resounding success, despite recent setbacks. Don’t worry that you have not made as much progress as you would have liked in recent weeks – there is still plenty of time to get it right. |02-11-2015|libra
429|Can you trust what someone tells you? According to the planets the only way to find out for sure is by doing what they say and seeing what happens. If they do let you down you won’t ever give them another chance.|02-12-2015|libra
430|You will find it easy to forgive other people’s mistakes today but not so easy to forgive your own. The trouble is you have set such high standards for yourself there are bound to be times when you cannot live up to them.|02-13-2015|libra
431|A friend will do something that annoys you this weekend and you won’t let the incident pass without comment. Hopefully they will get the message and back off, but if they don’t try not to make a war of it – it’s really not such a big deal.|02-14-2015|libra
432|Something you thought was hugely important will turn out to be of no importance at all around the time the Sun changes signs in midweek. Once you realize how easily you got it wrong you won’t make the same mistake twice. |02-15-2015|libra
433|You will learn a lot about certain people this week, especially people you share your life with on a day-to-day basis. But you will learn more if you adopt a spirit of detachment. In other words, don’t take what you see and hear personally. |02-16-2015|libra
434|The Sun is about to move into the most hard-working area of your chart but that does not mean you have to do everything yourself. Spread the load over the next few days, otherwise come the weekend you may have no energy left. |02-17-2015|libra
435|Try not to push yourself quite so hard over the next few days. You can save a lot of time and energy by learning from other people’s mistakes – unless, of course, you are the kind of Libra who enjoys making your own.|02-18-2015|libra
436|Something you are told may not ring true but don’t dismiss it out of hand. Conversely, something else you are told may seem obvious but don’t accept it without question. The only thing you can be sure of today is that nothing is for certain.|02-19-2015|libra
437|As Venus, planet of love, moves into the relationship area of your chart today it’s likely you will meet someone who gets your pulse racing. That’s great but don’t get carried away – yet. Are they more than just a passing fancy? Time will tell.|02-20-2015|libra
438|Like it or not you are not in the driving seat at the moment and will have to wait and see what other people do before deciding your own moves. The good news is they will likely do exactly what you were hoping they would. |02-21-2015|libra
439|Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs your daily routines will pile on the pressure over the next few days – but you can handle it. If you work hard during the day you will have the perfect excuse to party at night. |02-22-2015|libra
440|You may have to postpone something you were looking forward to either today or tomorrow but looking back from the end of the week you will be quite relieved you never got started. The universe is clearly trying to protect you. |02-23-2015|libra
441|Your mind may be sharp and clear at the moment but that does not necessarily mean the conclusions you reach will be right. A lot depends on whether the facts and figures you are working with can be trusted. Wherever possible, do your own research.|02-24-2015|libra
442|Forget about duties and responsibilities and do what makes you happy. The simple fact is you are not in the mood for work and if you try to force yourself to do things that don’t inspire you the end result will be frustration and tears. Relax. |02-25-2015|libra
443|You will get the chance today, tomorrow and over the weekend to make serious progress in a creative endeavor of some sort. But however well it goes don’t get carried away because there is a lot of work to do yet – it’s still early days.|02-26-2015|libra
444|You cannot solve your problems by throwing lots of cash at them – if anything that will just make matters worse. According to the planets it won’t be long before a better way presents itself, so give it time – and don’t worry so much.|02-27-2015|libra
445|For reasons you cannot explain you have got a bad feeling about what a friend or colleague is proposing to do. Most likely your sixth sense is trying to tell you that it is not a good idea. How can you make them see that too?|02-28-2015|libra
446|You will have to make some sort of detour this week and you could end up miles out of your way. Don’t worry about it though because wherever you go the scenery will be inspiring. There’s a lot of the world you still have to see.|03-01-2015|libra
447|If you have a good idea you must let others know about it, especially people whose support can help you turn it into a reality. Don’t keep your schemes and dreams to yourself: they are big enough for everyone to share in. |03-02-2015|libra
448|You won’t hesitate to get involved in some kind of dispute today, even if it has nothing to do with you. Just make sure you know your facts before delivering opinions you have not been asked for. Or do you like looking silly?|03-03-2015|libra
449|You will get along with just about everyone today, both on a personal and a professional level. Today’s links between Venus, your ruler, and Jupiter and Uranus will encourage you to see the best in people – all people, not just the ones you like.|03-04-2015|libra
450|Try not to provoke any arguments or showdowns today, because while the moon is full you are unlikely to be on the winning side. This is one of those occasions when the best approach by far is to keep a low profile.|03-05-2015|libra
451|If the only way to get what you want today is to reveal something about yourself that you would prefer to keep secret then maybe you are on the wrong track. According to the planets you may get the worst of the deal, so think again.|03-06-2015|libra
452|Follow your heart this weekend, no matter where it might lead you nor what others might have to say about it. Finding happiness is not about career success or making more money, it’s about being true to who and what you really are. |03-07-2015|libra
453|Friends and relatives will be even more demanding than usual this week – they seem to believe you exist purely to do things for them. At some point you are going to have to burst their bubble. Make it sooner rather than later.|03-08-2015|libra
454|Look for ways to co-operate with colleagues and people in positions of power. You have wasted enough time and energy trying to outdo each other, now you must go right the other way and work together as a team. Don’t laugh – it IS possible. |03-09-2015|libra
455|Make an effort to talk to loved ones and work colleagues and find out what they think and how they feel. Cosmic activity in your opposite signs of Aries means that if you are nice to other people they will be nice to you.|03-10-2015|libra
456|A relationship that has been going through a rocky phase needs to be dealt with once and for all. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Aries suggests it may be better to call it a day – but ultimately only you can decide.|03-11-2015|libra
457|Don’t take anything on trust today – check once, check twice, then check a third time just to be sure. Whatever you are planning you must make sure you have covered all the angles because the smallest overlooked detail could trip you up.|03-12-2015|libra
458|Common sense should tell you that certain routines and methods are not working as well as they should and what happens over the next two or three days will surely confirm that. Look for ways to update how you do things.|03-13-2015|libra
459|The problem you are struggling with is actually quite simple – it is your negative attitude that makes it look difficult! Try looking at life from a wider perspective and soon you will see that your “problem” is nothing of the sort.|03-14-2015|libra
460|You will accomplish more over the next few days if you don’t take life so seriously. Setbacks are a fact of life but you don’t have to let them get to you. What happened to that Libran sense of balance? It all comes right in the end. |03-15-2015|libra
461|Make sure you know what you are getting into today because if you let other people take charge and decide what you will be doing you could end up in a place you don’t really want to go. It may be better to just stay at home. |03-16-2015|libra
462|How you react to people today and tomorrow will to a large extent determine how well you do financially and career-wise over the next few months. Go out of your way to find solutions to existing problems rather than create new ones.|03-17-2015|libra
463|Tread carefully when dealing with partners and loved ones over the next 24 hours because even little things are likely to set them off. The last thing you need now is to spend your precious waking hours trying to calm them down.|03-18-2015|libra
464|Work and health matters will be uppermost in your mind today and tomorrow, which is good because you have been overdoing it of late. Put your physical wellbeing ahead of everything else. What use is success if you are too tired to enjoy it?|03-19-2015|libra
465|The Sun’s change of signs today means you are halfway through your solar year: a good point to look back and take stock of how far you have come. Only then will you be in the proper position to see how far you have still to go. |03-20-2015|libra
466|It might be an idea to take it easy this weekend, especially if you overdid it last weekend. Usually you start fast and run out of steam before the end. Over the next 48 hours, start slow and be there to challenge at the finish. |03-21-2015|libra
467|What changes can you make today so that tomorrow is not so fraught with anxieties? Your mind is clearer now than it has been for weeks, if not months, so one way or another you are sure to come up with a workable solution. |03-22-2015|libra
468|Your head may be full of big ideas but the planets warn this is not a good time to push too hard. You will achieve more in the long-term if you go with the flow rather than try to direct it over the next few days. |03-23-2015|libra
469|Don’t be too eager to uncover other people’s secrets or they may start digging around in your affairs – and who knows what they might find! No matter how interesting they may be there are some things that should always stay hidden.|03-24-2015|libra
470|One of the things you are good at is inspiring people to improve themselves and over the next few days you will help at least one friend, and maybe several, do more and do better. They will love you for it, even more than they do now.|03-25-2015|libra
471|You have been worrying about your money situation for no good reason and over the next few days you will see solutions where before you saw only problems. But that is not an excuse to go on yet another spending spree.|03-26-2015|libra
472|A new relationship will start today or over the weekend. It may or may not be romantic in nature but whatever guise it takes it will be fun. This is also a good time to interact with large groups of people. Do some charity work.|03-27-2015|libra
473|You will have to pull out of a social event you were looking forward to this weekend but although it may cause a certain amount of friction it’s the best thing to do. You have far more important things to worry about. You can party later.|03-28-2015|libra
474|Go out of your way to heal a rift with a partner or loved. It might be hard for you to say sorry, especially if you believe that you are the one who has been wronged, but is it really so important? Make the first move. |03-29-2015|libra
475|Is there some overall goal you are working towards in life? If there is, you will take a giant step closer towards it today. If not, now is the time to decide who or what you should devote yourself to – besides yourself, of course! |03-30-2015|libra
476|Make sure you know what is expected of you before signing up for something new. You may feel you can handle whatever fate sends your way but the planets warn that some deals are best avoided, no matter how enticing they may look. |03-31-2015|libra
477|You will need to read between the lines today because what someone is trying to tell you is simply not true. You like to believe the best of people, of course, but this is one of those occasions when you need to be suspicious.|04-01-2015|libra
478|You may have no idea how you reach certain conclusions today but don’t doubt them for a moment. Your mind is open on a much higher level now, so insights of one sort or another are to be expected – and embraced.|04-02-2015|libra
479|No matter how fast you may be traveling at this moment in time you must cut back on your speed over the next 48 hours. Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse in your sign makes accidents more likely then usual, so take care.|04-03-2015|libra
480|Because today’s lunar eclipse takes place in your sign you will easily get irritated with people who do not seem to share your energy and enthusiasm. But is it they who are dragging their feet or is it you who is being impulsive? Think about it.|04-04-2015|libra
481|Now that communications planet Mercury is moving through your opposite sign you should find it easier to deal with partners and loved ones. You will certainly be able to see things more from their point of view, which always helps. |04-05-2015|libra
482|Don’t do what other people expect you to do – do what appeals to you, for whatever reason. If you let partners and colleagues dictate terms they will, and you can be sure they won’t be as favorable to you as they could have been. |04-06-2015|libra
483|Try not to get annoyed if someone whose support you rely on opposes you in some way today. They are entitled to their point of view and if they disagree with you they have a duty to say so. Maybe you should listen.|04-07-2015|libra
484|This is one of the best times of the year for relationships, so don’t worry if you have not seen eye to eye with certain people of late because your differences are trivial. You are still very much on the same level mentally and emotionally.|04-08-2015|libra
485|The ball is very much in someone else’s court at the moment and all you can do is wait to see how they are going to play it. Don’t get impatient if they take their time about it because that will encourage them to go even slower.|04-09-2015|libra
486|Open up and reveal your true feelings today. If you are not happy with something, or someone, then say so. Don’t make it hard for others to read your mood. Let them know how you feel and what it is you need. You will get it.|04-10-2015|libra
487|You should have plans to be on the move over the next 48 hours because with Venus, your ruler, moving into the most adventurous area of your chart you are sure to have fun and meet special people – maybe even The Special One.|04-11-2015|libra
488|Can you trust what other people tell you? It depends when you ask. Midweek, when your ruler Venus opposes Saturn, is the time to be careful: don’t take anything on trust around this time. Check everything yourself – once, twice, then once again.|04-12-2015|libra
489|It may be time to get yourself free of a relationship that used to hold you up but is now holding you back. Only you can choose what your next step is going to be but once you have made your choice you must be decisive. |04-13-2015|libra
490|If you think you are owed something, be it money, respect, or whatever, you can get it today. Mercury will help you find the words that can persuade others to give you what you desire. They simply won’t dare tell you “no”.|04-14-2015|libra
491|A task you were not looking forward to won’t be as bad as you thought it would be – in fact, once you get going it may be enjoyable. That’s good, because the more you smile the happier those around you will be as well.|04-15-2015|libra
492|Have a good time today. Go out and enjoy yourself. But watch how much you spend and watch who you spend it on, because some of your so-called friends will bleed you dry if you let them. Save some cash for the weekend. |04-17-2015|libra
493|Partnerships, including affairs of the heart, are well starred this weekend, so make sure you do things with your nearest and dearest, because the time you spend in each other’s company is of huge importance. What you do together lasts forever.|04-18-2015|libra
494|Make sure you set your own targets for the week ahead. Others may say that some of your aims are impractical, and maybe they are, but don’t let that stop you. You won’t know what you are capable of until you try. So try! |04-19-2015|libra
495|The Sun leaves the relationship area of your chart today but that is not an excuse to pay less attention to the one you love. Show a little passion over the next 24 hours. They need to know you still care. And you do.|04-20-2015|libra
496|Make your own value judgments today. What others say may be interesting but it is essential that you follow your instincts rather than follow the herd. As a rule, when the mob says one thing most likely the opposite thing is correct.|04-21-2015|libra
497|You know exactly what you should be doing, even though you might find it hard to explain to others why you are doing it. But don’t let it worry you. Partners and loved ones will soon see there is method in your apparent madness.|04-22-2015|libra
498|If you ask someone for a favor today chances are they will be more than willing to help you out. But don’t expect to get what you want for free – you will have to do something for them in return. Find out what it is first.|04-23-2015|libra
499|There are ways to get what you want without turning people against you, so watch what you say and do and, especially, try to avoid treading on the toes of those who can tread back just as hard. Look for solutions, not confrontations.|04-24-2015|libra
500|The most important thing now is that you believe in yourself and that you don’t let others talk you into settling for average or second best. Your dreams may seem out of reach to them but no way are they out of reach to you. |04-25-2015|libra
501|A major change in your circumstances needs to be acknowledged and accepted this week. The fact that you have new obligations is a reason for cheer, not dismay. You said you wanted something new in your life – well here it is! |04-26-2015|libra
502|If you hesitate for even a moment today you could miss out on an opportunity that may not come again for a very long time. No matter how tiring your weekend may have been make sure you stay alert over the next 24 hours.|04-27-2015|libra
503|You seem to be having trouble at keeping a desire of some sort under wraps. Perhaps you should take the hint and let everyone know about it. According to the planets others will applaud you for being so open and honest.|04-28-2015|libra
504|Relationships of all kinds are under favorable stars right now, so even if there have been a few harsh words of late you can, if you wish, patch things up and be friends again. Sometimes a little falling-out can lead to big love.|04-29-2015|libra
505|Despite what some people might believe you rarely think only of yourself and you will get the chance to prove it over the next two or three days. You are at your best when fighting on the side of truth and justice. But always fight fair.|04-30-2015|libra
506|This is a good time to be on the move but if work and family commitments keep you stuck in one place you can at least make vacation plans for later in the year. Go somewhere exotic, somewhere that excites and inspires you. |05-01-2015|libra
507|The more so-called experts urge you to take a certain course of action the more wary you should be, especially if they try to convince you there is no way you can lose. Your instincts are telling you a different story. |05-02-2015|libra
508|You will be incredibly decisive over the next few days but you need to be careful too. The full moon demands that you act for a reason and not merely to impress other people. Save some energy for later in the week. |05-03-2015|libra
509|This could be a lucky day for you but it could also be the kind of day when what you gain with one hand you squander with the other. If you find you have more cash than you expected put it away for the proverbial rainy day. |05-04-2015|libra
510|Friends will make all sorts of promises over the next 24 hours but if you expect them to deliver you may be disappointed. They are not trying to cheat or mislead you as such but the simple fact is they have promised too much.|05-05-2015|libra
511|Do what you feel like doing today and ignore those who say you are doing it wrong or that you should be doing more for other people. The fact is you have done your share and have every right to reward yourself with something good.|05-06-2015|libra
512|Work and romance will go well together over the next two or three days – you don’t have to choose between them. Use your Libran charms to influence people in positions of power. Is it fair to do so? Of course it is.|05-07-2015|libra
513|It will pay you to keep your opinions to yourself today, especially on the work front where your know-it-all attitude is unlikely to go down too well. The best way to fall out with powerful people is to make them look stupid. |05-08-2015|libra
514|Something is wrong and needs to be put right. You know what it is and you know what must be done but do you have the courage to make changes? Of course you do. Librans know that everything must balance out in the end. |05-09-2015|libra
515|You may get more than you bargained for on the work front this week but you will handle it with ease. Now that Mars is moving in your favor again there is precious little you cannot do – and that applies to your love life too. |05-10-2015|libra
516|You may be tempted to own up to some kind of indiscretion, simply to get rid of the guilt feelings you have been carrying round, but is that such a good idea? Some things are best not spoken about at all, for everyone’s sake. |05-11-2015|libra
517|There is no point trying to relax now that Mars, planet of energy, is moving into your fellow Air sign of Gemini. There are so many things you want to do and so many people and places you want to see. Go for it!|05-12-2015|libra
518|Ideas will come thick and fast today but to make the most of them you will have to be selective. You won’t get far if you try to follow up on each and every one of them – it’s simply not possible. Do less, or think less!|05-13-2015|libra
519|Let others take care of you for a change. Life has been tough of late and you deserve a break – in fact you deserve a vacation. You will be working hard again soon enough, so take it easy while you can and don’t feel guilty about it.|05-14-2015|libra
520|Whatever challenges come your way today you will deal with them with ease. This is one of those occasions when you need to be tested, when you need to be pushed to your limits and beyond. And what a Libra needs a Libra gets.|05-15-2015|libra
521|A wonderful link between your ruler Venus and Neptune, planet of imagination, means you will come up with some great ideas this weekend. Some of them may seem a bit outlandish but don’t reject them – they could make you a fortune.|05-16-2015|libra
522|The planets warn you have been far too generous of late. You have given too much of your time, energy and money and now you are beginning to feel the effects. Call a halt now and start building up your reserves again. |05-17-2015|libra
523|Try not to focus too intently on your own affairs today or you will miss what is going on in the world around you. You can learn a lot from what partners and colleagues say and do, and even more from the mistakes they make. |05-18-2015|libra
524|You may have strayed a little off course of late but don’t worry about it. What happens today will point you in the right direction and make you realize that you are really not that far away from where you should be.|05-19-2015|libra
525|Put your worries behind you and let a big smile spread across your face. Once the Sun moves into your fellow Air sign of Gemini tomorrow there will be no holding you back – it will be love and laughs all the way.|05-20-2015|libra
526|There were times of late when you did not have the first idea what was going on but now the Sun is moving in your favor again you will see with the utmost clarity – and what you see will most likely delight you.|05-21-2015|libra
527|Someone in a position of authority may be annoying but you need to remember that they have more power than you. You won’t have to agree with every word they say but you will sometimes have to make it look as if you agree.|05-22-2015|libra
528|Be careful that someone you work or do business with does not let you down over the next 48 hours. You don’t have to be too suspicious but you must not let your guard down completely. Anyone who says “trust me” is best avoided. |05-23-2015|libra
529|This is not the time for second thoughts, still less for regrets. You know what you want, you know where to get it, and you know you can now make a serious play for fame and fortune. Put the past behind you once and for all.|05-24-2015|libra
530|Let others know what is on your mind by all means but don’t say it in a way that might antagonize those you live and work with. Sometimes it is better to approach the truth from an angle rather than confront it head-on.|05-25-2015|libra
531|Do you see things the way they are or the way you would like them to be? That’s an important question because the planets warn you could be a little too optimistic for your own good today. Be positive but be realistic too. |05-26-2015|libra
