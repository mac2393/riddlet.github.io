0|Because Tuesday’s new moon falls in the most creative and dynamic sector of your chart you will be full of yourself over the next few days. You will also attract the kind of people who make fun things happen. Together you’ll have a blast!|12-01-2013|leo
1|What others expect of you is not important – what matters is what you expect of yourself. Others may say you should be doing this or doing that today but you must reject it all and do only what makes you happy.|12-02-2013|leo
2|Yours is one of the most favored signs at the moment and today’s new moon in your fellow Fire sign of Sagittarius urges you to cash in on your creative ideas. Do what feels right to you, not what others say can or should be done.|12-03-2013|leo
3|You may have no particular interest in the chores you are expected to do today, but do them anyway and make sure you do a good job. Come the weekend you will be free again to pursue your own interests with a clear conscience.|12-04-2013|leo
4|Mercury, planet of communication and the mind, joins the Sun in the most creative area of your chart today. What does that mean in plain English? It means you must let the world know of your achievements – of which there are plenty. |12-05-2013|leo
5|There are only so many hours in a day, even for a Leo, so identify your priorities and don’t try to do everything at once. Aim for quality rather than quantity in all things at all times – one way or another it will be enough.|12-06-2013|leo
6|You need to have a definite objective in mind and a clear-cut plan to help you to reach it. If so, there is nothing you cannot do over the next few days. A little bit of forethought will bring rewards beyond your wildest dreams.|12-07-2013|leo
7|Others may try to disrupt your plans over the next few days but they will only succeed if they are so inflexible that minor setbacks cause major problems. Be ready and willing to adapt – it’s what separates the winners from the losers. |12-08-2013|leo
8|Make sure you focus on positive things as the new week begins because if you allow negative thoughts to get a hold you will find it hard to shake them off again. Whatever your current problems may be they’re not as bad as they seem.|12-09-2013|leo
9|You need to sit down and have a heart-to-heart talk with someone you care for. A lot of things have been said and done in recent days and the time has come to clear the air. Be honest about your feelings and let them be honest too.|12-10-2013|leo
10|You need to get your financial house in order and you need to do so quickly. Be ruthless with yourself and make sure you know the difference between your needs and your desires. If something is not an absolute necessity then live without it.|12-11-2013|leo
11|It may be hard for you to understand why certain people act in certain ways but there is no point getting worked up about it because you won’t change the way they are. Try acting as if you don’t care in the slightest what they do.|12-12-2013|leo
12|You may have to do something that makes you unpopular today but that won’t worry you one bit. You know there are times when you have to put duty before pleasure and this is clearly one of them. Do it and do it well.|12-13-2013|leo
13|You don’t seem quite so concerned now about what you earn and how much you spend and that’s good. Leos do best when they focus on the bigger picture and money is such a little thing. Make having fun your priority this weekend.|12-14-2013|leo
14|You tend to stick with what you know and trust and most of the time it works but over the next few days you may have to update your ideas a bit. Ultimately, everyone has to move with the times – yes, even a Leo!|12-15-2013|leo
15|Others may be having second thoughts about what you are doing but you have no such doubts. Even if you do make a mistake or two along the way your momentum and sense of purpose will keep you moving towards your goal.|12-16-2013|leo
16|You may be brave by nature but taking risks is best avoided today, especially on the home front where loved ones are unlikely to see the funny side of your pranks – and even less if they have to come and rescue you.|12-17-2013|leo
17||12-18-2013|leo
18|You have been in impressive form of late but all good things must come to an end and life may not be quite so easy when the Sun changes signs on the 21st. If there is anything of a creative nature that needs doing then do it now. |12-19-2013|leo
19|A moment’s hesitation could cause you grief – at the very least you will kick yourself for not trusting your instincts. Don’t listen to those who say you should be cautious. It may be good advice for them but it’s not right for you.|12-20-2013|leo
20|The past few weeks have seen you at your most confident and dynamic but now you need to pay a bit more attention to the little things – but only a bit. Don’t lose sight of the big picture but find ways to paint it on an everyday canvas.|12-21-2013|leo
21|Life is supposed to be fun and will continue to be fun if you don’t let minor issues get to you. Also, don’t waste time worrying that others are not so fortunate. Be happy and successful yourself and be the example they want to follow.|12-22-2013|leo
22|Sit down, put your feet up and let others do all the running around. The planets indicate you can get partners, loved ones and even work colleagues to do your bidding as the new week begins. It is, after all, the natural order of things.|12-23-2013|leo
23|Matters of a routine nature will take up a lot of time but once you have completed your tasks you can move on to something more interesting. Whatever else you do today, don’t cut corners as it could cost you a lot more than you can afford.|12-24-2013|leo
24|The more you try to focus on a particular task the more your mind seems to wander and the more frustrated you get. Take the hint and stop trying so hard. Go easy on yourself today and let life come to you for a change.|12-25-2013|leo
25|You may be tempted to change something that has worked for years, but is that such a good idea? In your present mood there is every possibility that you will go too far and change things in a revolutionary rather than an evolutionary way.|12-26-2013|leo
26|Take nothing for granted over the next 24 hours, not even things you have done a thousand times before. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your work and your daily routine. Make sure what you are doing is done right.|12-27-2013|leo
27|Stop wasting time and energy trying to make sense of things that to your way of thinking make no sense at all. You don’t have to fit everything in your life into a neat and tidy box. Some things are destined to remain a mystery.|12-28-2013|leo
28|It may be the party season but you still have work to do and because of that you may have to cut back a bit on the fun and games this week. Of course, you’ll have more time for work and play if you organize your time more efficiently.|12-29-2013|leo
29|The approaching new moon will make it abundantly clear what needs to be done to sort out a work or health problem of some kind. Actually you’ve known for a while but you keep putting it off. This time you must act quickly and decisively.|12-30-2013|leo
30|Try not to get upset about anything today, especially issues that are trivial in the extreme. The planets warn that your health could suffer if you get too emotional, so be positive and avoid negative thinking — and negative people. |12-31-2013|leo
31|You may feel so good about yourself now that you believe you can push yourself harder than ever before and not worry about the consequences. Push yourself hard if you must but give yourself plenty of rest as well. Balance is essential.|01-01-2014|leo
32|Your confidence may sink a bit today but it’s only a passing phase so don’t worry about it. Most likely you are the only one whowill notice anyway. A Leo who lacks confidence still looks and sounds like a winner to everyone else.|01-02-2014|leo
33|Your mind is extraordinarily active at the moment and that’s good, but make sure you write down any insights you have otherwise you may forget them by the end of the day. Carry a pen and notebook with you at all times.|01-03-2014|leo
34|You may not see the point in what you are being asked to do, but as it is for someone you respect and look up to, you will do it anyway. Don’t worry, everything will fall into place and make sense come Monday morning.|01-04-2014|leo
35|Be careful you don’t miss something that is small but important over the next few days. Set aside some time in your busy schedule for looking at the bigger picture – once you “get it” the details will start to make more sense too.|01-05-2014|leo
36|There may be a certain amount of tension in the air over the next few days and it may even linger until Mercury changes signs next weekend. It won’t cause you any major problems but try not to snap at people for no good reason.|01-06-2014|leo
37|Everything must be in its proper place, and if it isn’t then someone is going to get the blame — and it won’t be you. You may be easy-going most of the time, but sometimes you are like your next-door-neighbor sign Virgo — obsessed by details. |01-07-2014|leo
38|No matter how unsettling the changes that are now taking place may be keep telling yourself that in the long-term they will work in your favor. Your life story is unfolding and evolving exactly as it should. You don’t have to change a thing.|01-08-2014|leo
39|This is a good day for friendship and even more so for romance and if anyone is of the opinion that you lack passion they will soon see the error of their ways. When a Leo gets fired up the heat is enough to melt the coldest of hearts.|01-09-2014|leo
40|If you have done something you are proud of then shout about it and let everyone know. You are no stranger to drawing attention to yourself but this is one of those occasions when you have every right to go on a lap of honor.|01-10-2014|leo
41||01-11-2014|leo
42|Flattery will get you almost everywhere this week but it won’t get you the one place you really want to go. As a Leo you demand honesty of other people, so why should they not demand honesty of you? Just tell the truth.|01-12-2014|leo
43|You may know what you are after but you still need help in getting it. If you don’t ask for assistance today you may find yourself being left behind on the work front. Next time, try not to take on so many tasks all at once.|01-13-2014|leo
44|It might be a smart idea to take a closer look at howyou organize your everyday affairs. Start thinking of ways you can make your routines simpler and your chores less of a burden. One way, of course, is to get others to do them for you.|01-14-2014|leo
45|You will fall out with someone you usually get along with today, most likely because you cannot agree on issues of a philosophical nature. Fortunately, you will also find it easy to make up and be friends again, so it’s no big deal.|01-15-2014|leo
46|Don’t take it personally if family and friends are hard to get through to today: it seems they have a lot on their minds at the moment. If there are issues you need to discuss, wait until tomorrow when they won’t be quite so worried by life.|01-16-2014|leo
47|Today’s Mercury-Uranus link will give you an advantage in that it helps you see things way ahead of everyone else. However, other aspects warn that what you see over the weekend may be misleading, so don’t get carried away.|01-17-2014|leo
48|Relationships of one sort or another will be much on your mind this weekend but don’t make any major decisions until the Sun changes signs on Monday. Only then will you begin to see what certain people really mean to you.|01-18-2014|leo
49|The Sun moves into the partnership area of your chart on Monday, making it easy to persuade those you live and work with to see things your way. Even if it turns out later that your way is the wrong way they will happily forgive you.|01-19-2014|leo
50|For the next few weeks the Sun will be moving through your opposite sign of Aquarius, so opposition of one kind or another is to be expected. Make things easy for yourself: take others’ needs and wishes into consideration more often.|01-20-2014|leo
51|Now that the Sun is transiting your opposite sign of Aquarius you must make an effort to see things from alternative points of view. Also, don’t criticize people you care for just because they fail to live up to your high standards. Nobody ever does.|01-21-2014|leo
52|Someone’s negative attitudes are getting you down more than you care to admit, so if you have been thinking of bringing a partnership to an end now is the time to be decisive. Don’t feel sorry for them – it’s your peace of mind that matters.|01-22-2014|leo
53|Someone you live or work with is harboring a secret grudge and if you say the wrong thing they will find a way to use it against you. Think before you speak and make sure you know what you are talking about. Is that so hard?|01-23-2014|leo
54|Honesty is essential if you are to resolve an issue that has been dragging on forever. But that does not only mean you being honest with others, it also means others being honest with you. Encourage them to speak up. Find out what they think.|01-24-2014|leo
55|You must be under no illusions as to what is important and what is not – and what you stand to lose if you get them mixed up. Be on your guard when making deals with people whose motives are vague. They could be up to no good.|01-25-2014|leo
56|No matter how bad your own situation may be you must make time to help partners and loved ones solve their problems. They need someone with your no-nonsense nature to give them the kick start they need. You can do that.|01-26-2014|leo
57|If you work with the planets this week you will find ways to shape your destiny. If you work against them your destiny will still change but maybe not in ways you feel comfortable with. Find which way the wind is blowing and blow with it.|01-27-2014|leo
58|Although you think you know what is going on you would still be wise to wait a day or two before making any major decisions. In fact, for best results bide your time until Thursday when the moon is new in your opposite sign. What’s the rush?|01-28-2014|leo
59|Your aims and ambitions may seem impractical to some, but so what? The approaching new moon will give you a head start on your rivals, and no matter how far behind you may be at this moment, you will soon be ahead of the pack.|01-29-2014|leo
60|Whatever goals you set your sights on over the next few days you will reach them with ease. But don’t spend all your time and energy on work: this is potentially one of the best days of the year for affairs of the heart.|01-30-2014|leo
61|There may be a thousand and one chores you would like to avoid but you can’t, so don’t waste time on wishful thinking. Positive thinking, however, is to be encouraged, so imagine you are having the time of your life. Your thoughts will make it happen.|01-31-2014|leo
62|A project will have to be postponed for a while, which won’t please you, but in the long-term it will work out fine. In fact a delay is just what you need as it will help you get your ideas together. You must be clear about your aims.|02-01-2014|leo
63|You won’t have to make much effort or spend much money to get what you desire over the next few days. Your powers of persuasion have rarely been higher and if you ask for something you will get it with no questions asked.|02-03-2014|leo
64|It might be tempting to work even harder and faster but you will accomplish more in the long-term if you start slowly and think about what you are doing. And don’t let colleagues and employers pressure you into doing too much.|02-04-2014|leo
65|Anyone who thinks they can trick you into doing something that is not in your interests is in for a rude awakening. One such individual will try to put one over on you today, but they will end up looking extremely foolish. |02-05-2014|leo
66|Unexpected events will disrupt your routine today and, to say the least, you won’t be happy about it. But as there is nothing you can do to change things there’s really not much point getting uptight about it, is there? Stay calm and carry on.|02-06-2014|leo
67|You need to make a decision about a partnership or relationship matter. If you don’t the issue will be taken out of your hands and other people will make the decision for you – and almost certainly they won’t do what pleases you.|02-07-2014|leo
68|It’s time for a clear-out. There are a number of things in your life that you no longer need, so make a list of what they are then get rid of them all in one go. You can be surprisingly ruthless when you put your mind to it!|02-08-2014|leo
69|Steer clear of other people’s disputes today. No matter how well-intentioned you may be you are likely to end up supporting the wrong side, which won’t do your reputation for picking winners much good. The only side you need to be on is your own.|02-10-2014|leo
70|The planets are encouraging you to go with the flow and let others call the shots for a while. Being a Leo and a natural born leader that may not be easy but every now and again it’s good to take a back seat for a change. |02-11-2014|leo
71|You must deal with a money worry you have been doing your best to ignore. Now that Mercury is about to begin one of its retrograde phases you will have to be totally honest with yourself, because no one else will be.|02-12-2014|leo
72|Like everyone you have secrets and one particular secret could be dangerous if other people get to know about it. Make sure you don’t say or do anything today that might give your opponents a clue as to what you’ve been up to.|02-13-2014|leo
73|Not everyone will agree with what you intend to do this weekend but that won’t worry you in the slightest – in fact you rather enjoy going against what the so-called experts say is the right way of doing things. You know better.|02-15-2014|leo
74|If you need to make changes to a partnership of some kind then do so today because once the Sun begins a new cycle tomorrow it won’t be so easy. Also, if you negotiate changes now you won’t have to pay too much for them.|02-17-2014|leo
75|You cannot afford to back down today. The planets warn if you give ground once you will be expected to give ground again and again and soon you will be in full retreat. Leos are supposed to be stubborn, so dig in your heels (and claws).|02-18-2014|leo
76|Steer clear of people who seem to enjoy talking about their worries and woes. It may make them feel good to feel bad, but it will bring you down from your high and spoil what might otherwise be a marvelous day. Be upbeat at all times. |02-19-2014|leo
77|It will pay you to be a bit more ruthless today, especially when dealing with people who always seem to get more out of your relationship than you do. Look tough, talk tough and, when the time comes, act tough too. Earn their respect.|02-20-2014|leo
78|You will discover something new about a friend or colleague today and although it may shock you a bit you will also be impressed, not least because they managed to keep it a secret so long. But don’t go telling everyone. It can still be private.|02-21-2014|leo
79|With the Sun linked to Neptune, planet of generosity, the only real danger this weekend is that you might be too giving and forgiving for your own good. Be warned that some people will take advantage of you if they get the chance.|02-22-2014|leo
80|You need to be careful where business issues are concerned this week, and if you are offered some kind of deal you must investigate it thoroughly. The devil is in the details and if you miss the small print you may have to pay.|02-23-2014|leo
81|Focus on what you own and earn and make sure you are getting paid the right amount for your considerable talents. If you allow yourself to be cheated out of small amounts now you will be cheated out of larger amounts later on.|02-24-2014|leo
82|You seem to be in one of your more impulsive moods and that could lead to something good . . . or something bad. You will get yourself into some risky situations – the sort you like best – but you know how to get out of them too.|02-25-2014|leo
83|Be careful you don’t get swept along by events and end up doing things you might later regret. It’s rarely a good idea to follow the herd and someone with your switched on and enquiring mind has no need to let others think for them.|02-26-2014|leo
84|Be careful what you ask for over the next two or three days because you are likely to get it. Why could that be a problem? Because the responsibilities that go with it could take away a lot of the fun. Only say it if you mean it.|02-27-2014|leo
85|A friend or loved one will speak their mind today and what they have to say will undoubtedly shock you. You never realized they could be so passionate, or so angry. Well, now you know, so what are you going to do about it?|02-28-2014|leo
86|Something that has been worrying you for ages will no longer be a problem after today. Money matters, especially, will look much more positive than they have done for a very long time. One way or another you will get what you need.|03-01-2014|leo
87|You will be under a lot of pressure this week, but nothing will happen that you cannot handle, so keep your wits about you and don’t give in to panic. You have what it takes to win in all kinds of situations, so believe in yourself.|03-02-2014|leo
88|The week ahead will be busy in the extreme but you’re ready for the challenges that will come your way – in fact you’re eager for them. Don’t wait for others to take the lead, take it yourself and inspire others to follow you.|03-03-2014|leo
89|Someone whose personality is as strong as your own will refuse to follow your lead today and, to say the least, you won’t be too happy about it. But what can you do? Let them do their own thing. You don’t need them anyway.|03-04-2014|leo
90|Venus, planet of love, moves into the relationship area of your chart today, so anything of a partnership nature will go well. No matter how busy you may be at work take time to remind that one special person how much they mean to you.|03-05-2014|leo
91|You will no doubt wonder what the catch is when someone in a position of authority offers you something you have long desired, but there is no need to be suspicious. They are not setting you up to knock you down. Not this time anyway!|03-06-2014|leo
92|The planets urge you not to plan too far ahead because even routine matters are likely to change over the days, weeks and months to come. You also need to be a bit more flexible. Know when it is in your interests to change course.|03-07-2014|leo
93|Anything you do on impulse today and tomorrow will most likely work out well. Your impatience with restrictions, especially in your career, may cause some friction but it will also impress those above you in the workplace hierarchy.|03-08-2014|leo
94|It’s okay to put off a task that not only does not have to be done right away but which you can easily get others to do for you. What happens over the next seven days is likely to make it irrelevant anyway, so why worry?|03-09-2014|leo
95|Try not to commit yourself to anything that cannot be changed at a moment’s notice. The planets are unsettled to say the least, so keep things fluid and be prepared to drop what you are working on and start something new and exciting.|03-10-2014|leo
96|Try not to worry about personal or money problems. The cosmic picture suggests that your state of mind will be much more positive once next weekend’s full moon has swept away certain doubts and obstructions. No, the sky is not about to fall!|03-11-2014|leo
97|You know just what to say and do to win friends and relatives round to your way of thinking. Whether your way of thinking is correct is, of course, another matter entirely – but since when do Leos worry about little things like that?|03-12-2014|leo
98|If you don’t want to do something then leave it. Others may moan that you should be making more of an effort but they’re wrong. You should work only on things that interest you. Anything else can safely be left to another day, or year.|03-13-2014|leo
99|Are you promising more than you can deliver? Maybe, but your confidence is so high at the moment that the thought of failure does not cross your mind, which in turn makes success more likely. Will you be able to deliver the goods? We’ll see!|03-14-2014|leo
100|You may be a bit short of cash this weekend but you have only yourself to blame. If you are honest you will admit you have been rather extravagant of late. Take it as a gentle reminder that you need to get your financial house in order.|03-15-2014|leo
101|The Sun crosses one of the more dynamic angles of your chart in midweek and inevitably the pace of life will pick up – and about time. The past few weeks have been a bit of a slog. Now, at last, you can have some fun.|03-16-2014|leo
102|Everyone makes mistakes, so don’t beat yourself up just because you got something wrong. The important thing is that you recognize where you made an error and resolve not to make it again. Failure can often be a stepping stone to success.|03-17-2014|leo
103|Give partners and loved ones room to be themselves. Allow them to go off and do their own thing at their own speed in their own way. If you try to restrict their movements you will succeed only in making them more rebellious.|03-18-2014|leo
104|You may want to make an issue of something but before you do make sure the facts are on your side. Remember, too, that it’s not enough to tell others that they are doing it wrong – they also need to be shown how to do it right.|03-19-2014|leo
105|Nothing matters more than the truth and if you keep that thought in mind over the next few days you won’t go far wrong. The truth may at times be uncomfortable but that is not an excuse to ignore it or to follow illusions rather than facts.|03-20-2014|leo
106|The planets warn that anything you do in haste over the next 24 hours will be repented for days if not weeks to come. Slow down, take your time and make sure you have made the correct decisions before you take any action.|03-21-2014|leo
107|This is one of the best times of the year for you but the current cosmic climate warns you should hold off starting anything new until Monday at the earliest. Only then will you have a clear idea of the road you are destined to take.|03-22-2014|leo
108|You may not agree that someone deserves all the attention they are getting but that’s how it is. Instead of getting angry about it why don’t you do something that pulls the spotlight away from them? You’ve got ten times their star quality.|03-23-2014|leo
109|Don’t let anyone restrict your freedoms. You need to let those who would like to take away your right to think and speak for yourself that you are not having it, that you will fight them all the way. And you must mean it.|03-24-2014|leo
110|You’re not the sort to stick with what you know and trust and that’s good. The more you are on the move today, the more you are meeting new people and trying new things, the more likely it is you will find happiness and success.|03-25-2014|leo
111|Either you will come into money today or you will come up with a plan that makes you money at some stage in the future. If it’s the latter, be patient. Some things are worth waiting for and true wealth is one of them.|03-26-2014|leo
112|If you need help over the next 24 hours then come right out and ask for it. If you wait for others to realize that you require assistance chances are you will never get it – not because they don’t care but because they can’t read your mind.|03-27-2014|leo
113|If someone suggests that you need to prove your commitment to them then maybe you should reconsider the status of your relationship. As far as you are concerned it is a partnership of equals. If they can’t agree with that then say goodbye.|03-28-2014|leo
114|Try not to take life so seriously this weekend. Yes, of course, you have ambitions and responsibilities like everyone else but if you treat life as a gift to be enjoyed rather than a trial to be endured you’ll find things go a lot better for you.|03-29-2014|leo
115|Do something out of the ordinary this week. Do something that not even your best friends would expect of you. Wednesday’s Sun-Uranus link will inspire you to misbehave, to shock, to flout authority. Just be careful you don’t get arrested. |03-30-2014|leo
116|Your dominant position will be challenged over the next few days and you will have to fight hard to retain your status. Anyone who thinks you will roll over and give up obviously does not know you too well, which is a point in your favor.|03-31-2014|leo
117|You may want to be friends with everyone but today’s Sun-Jupiter link warns you need to be discerning. The fact is there are some people who you will never get along with because you are on different emotional and intellectual levels.|04-01-2014|leo
118|Someone will make a big deal of something that to you is of no real significance. There is no point trying to reason it through because reason is an alien concept to them at the moment. Stay out of their way until they come to their senses.|04-02-2014|leo
119|You seem to be working harder than ever of late but are you working for yourself or are you working for other people? That’s the question you most need to ask today and if the answer is the latter you will need to make changes.|04-03-2014|leo
120|If there is something important that needs to be done over the next two or three days then get on with it and ignore those who say you’re not up to the task. They have no idea what you are capable of – though they will soon find out!|04-04-2014|leo
121|Money matters and business issues seem to be worrying you quite a bit of late but you can make things easier for yourself this weekend by letting partners and loved ones take decisions for you. Can you trust them? Yes you can.|04-05-2014|leo
122|You can expect some kind of good fortune over the next few days, although it may not be of a material or financial nature. Most likely your mind will be opened to new and uplifting ideas – and that’s worth much more than money.|04-06-2014|leo
123|Get out and about. Do something different and exciting. This is a great time to take the kind of break where you get away from routine matters and challenge yourself to have as much fun as is humanly possible – and that’s a lot!|04-07-2014|leo
124|Do you like a challenge? Of course you do and that’s just as well because if you want to remain a contender, especially on the work front, you will need to up your game over the next two or three days. Winning is everything.|04-08-2014|leo
125|Others may have doubts about what you are doing but you have no doubts at all and will push ahead regardless. The Sun in Aries endows you with loads of energy and almost limitless self-belief and that’s a combination that can’t be beaten.|04-09-2014|leo
126|Try not to expose yourself to any kind of situation where you do not have full control over what happens. Your confidence may be high at the moment but that will not protect you from people who do not share your sense of fair play.|04-10-2014|leo
127|Over the next week or so you will find yourself thinking more and more about your career and your long-term ambitions. The need to make money may be a motivating factor but the most important thing is that you work at something you love.|04-11-2014|leo
128|Today’s Sun-Saturn link urges you to be cautious but not so cautious that you fail to do anything at all. If you get the urge to travel that’s fine but make sure loved ones know where you are going and when you’ll be back.|04-12-2014|leo
129|The planets warn you need to make up your mind soon about where you intend to be six months from now. Within a matter of days a new opportunity will knock at your door but you need to be ready to make a long-term commitment.|04-13-2014|leo
130|Don’t try too hard to stay on top of your workload today. The deadlines you have set yourself are unnecessary – no one will think less of you if you fail to meet them. Why make such a big effort when you really don’t have to?|04-14-2014|leo
131|By all means listen to what friends and family members have to tell you but don’t think for a moment it’s all true. Act on the assumption that you have not yet heard the whole story. Use your intelligence to fill in the gaps.|04-15-2014|leo
132|You may have to defend what you believe in today, and you should do so with every weapon at your disposal. Don’t ever forget that you are as entitled to your viewpoints and opinions as other people are to their own. And yours are better!|04-16-2014|leo
133|Someone in a position of authority is watching you closely and if they like what they see you could be in for a promotion or a pay rise – or both – when the Sun moves into the career area of your chart at the weekend. Look and act sharp!|04-17-2014|leo
134|You will accomplish more over the next two or three days if you can get yourself out of the habit of trying to do everything on your own. Working with others may not always be fun but you don’t have to like people to get things done.|04-18-2014|leo
135|You must be clear in your mind what it is you are aiming for, especially in your career, because if you have doubts you may waste a golden opportunity to get ahead in the world. Whatever you do, make sure you’re the best.|04-19-2014|leo
136|There is no doubt you have big ambitions and there is no doubt you will go far but you don’t have to act in haste. The Sun remains in the career area of your chart for the next four weeks, so take your time and make the right decisions.|04-20-2014|leo
137|As Uranus, planet of changes, squares up to Pluto, planet of power, over the next 24 hours you will understand why it is wrong to try to force people to do things against their will, even in a good cause. Put simply: it doesn’t work.|04-21-2014|leo
138|You can be a bit impetuous at times and the planets warn you must make sure you know what is going on before jumping head first into situation you know little about. Let others make the first moves – and give them a push if needs be.|04-22-2014|leo
139|Mercury, planet of the mind, crosses the career angle of your chart today, which means you will no longer be able to kid yourself about what is and is not possible, especially on the career front. It’s time to get serious about your ambitions.|04-23-2014|leo
140|With both the Sun and Mercury moving through the status area of your chart you will make friends with the right sort of people and there is no telling where that might lead. Get to know some VIPs – and very soon you’ll be one yourself.|04-24-2014|leo
141|Make sure you get value for money today because if you don’t take care of your cash others will get rich at your expense. You may not care now how much things are costing you but you will care later when you can no longer afford them.|04-25-2014|leo
142|This weekend’s cosmic influences will help you break free of situations that are holding you back from fulfilling your true potential. But it won’t just happen as if by magic – the desire and the effort, as always, must come from you.|04-26-2014|leo
143|A solar eclipse in the career area of your chart this week will inspire you to accomplish remarkable things. Set your sights high, believe in yourself, then act on that belief. Almost immediately your dreams will start to come true.|04-27-2014|leo
144|Put yourself forward and show what you can do. Employers and others in positions of power are looking for people who are decisive, for people who have no doubts, for people who are prepared to risk all to gain all. And that’s you.|04-28-2014|leo
145|Today’s solar eclipse in the career area of your chart will give you the energy and the confidence to put yourself forward and let people in positions of power and authority know you are special. This is no time for false modesty Leo!|04-29-2014|leo
146|You will come in for criticism of some kind today but if you are smart you will ignore it completely. At best it is misguided, at worst it is sour grapes. The simple fact is some people envy you for being such a larger-than-life character.|04-30-2014|leo
147|If a project does not seem to be working out or if your ultimate goal is as far away as ever, perhaps you should take it as a sign that something is wrong. It’s not too late to change course – only your ego is holding you back.|05-01-2014|leo
148|Slow down and give your physical, mental and emotional batteries a chance to recharge. The good news is you have already made a big impression on someone in a position of power – you really don’t have to keep proving yourself.|05-02-2014|leo
149|Don’t push too hard to change things this weekend, either in your personal life or at work. The planets indicate you will achieve more in the long-term if you react to how things happen rather than try to make them happen for yourself.|05-03-2014|leo
150|Make sure your voice is heard this week. And remember it’s not about how loud you shout but how well your know your facts and how confidently you express them. You’re a leader by nature and others will want to follow you.|05-04-2014|leo
151|You will be much in demand socially today but you must choose carefully among the many invitations you receive because you won’t have the time or the energy to say yes to them all. Which of them will further your status the most?|05-05-2014|leo
152|The planets warn that you may have deviated from your blueprint by a small amount, so maybe you should stand back from what you are working on and make sure it is still going according to plan. If not, make whatever changes are necessary.|05-06-2014|leo
153|The message of the stars for you today is that you must allow friends and family members to make more decisions for themselves. Over the past few weeks you have insisted on taking the lead but now it’s time to give others a chance.|05-07-2014|leo
154|It’s good that you know how to be assertive when dealing with important people but the planets warn you must not go too far. If you break the rules over the next 24 hours someone higher up the ladder than you will make you pay for it.|05-08-2014|leo
155|Make sure you do not commit yourself to anything you cannot back out of later, especially if there is money at stake. Most of the time your instincts can be trusted but this may be the one time in a thousand when they let you down.|05-09-2014|leo
156|The Sun in the career area of your chart makes you ultra ambitious but as Saturn, planet of limitation, is also strong this weekend you may have to rein in your aspirations, at least for a while. That’s okay – you don’t have to do it all at once.|05-10-2014|leo
157|Don’t be too hard on yourself this week. Not even a Leo can get it right every time and if something goes badly wrong you should put it down to experience and move on quickly. There are still plenty of successes coming your way.|05-11-2014|leo
158|Something you have kept secret for a long time will come to the surface over the next few days. In a way it will be a relief as you will no longer have to play silly games and pretend to be who and what you know you are not.|05-12-2014|leo
159|You will be extraordinarily assertive on the work front over the next few days, which is good, but you could also annoy people who think you are trying to usurp their position. You must stay on good terms with those in positions of power.|05-13-2014|leo
160|The Sun in the career area of your chart is on your side but other forces are at work that are trying to deny you the chance to move up in the world. Don’t give in to negative people or the negative thoughts they try to sow in your mind.|05-14-2014|leo
161|No matter how many things may have gone wrong in your life in recent weeks your luck will change for the better today. Actually luck has little to do with it. It’s your attitude that creates your world, so start smiling – and winning – again.|05-15-2014|leo
162|You may not be a team player by nature — unless it’s as the team leader — but cooperation has its benefits and what you do with other people today will have a bigger effect than what you do on your own. Everyone benefits.|05-16-2014|leo
163|You will be in the spotlight this weekend, which is nothing new, but don’t expect others to be as admiring as they have been of late. If there are any flaws in your act you must expect those who envy your popularity to point them out.|05-17-2014|leo
164|Friendships are always important but they will assume even greater significance this week, especially if you are the sort of Leo who is aggressively ambitious. You can’t do it all on your own – but with powerful friends all things are possible.|05-18-2014|leo
165|Something you thought was going well may suffer an unexpected setback over the next 24 hours. Whatever the cause and whatever the consequences it is not the end of the world, so don’t overreact. You’ll come up with a solution.|05-19-2014|leo
166|You don’t have to commit yourself to something if it doesn’t feel right. Others may try to make you feel guilty about leaving them in the lurch but it is your own needs that take precedence. Always be true to yourself.|05-20-2014|leo
167|Get out and about and meet people who share your way of looking at things. On an individual level there is only so much you can do, but acting with others all things become possible. Change your outlook and change the world too.|05-21-2014|leo
168|Others will be happy to do what you ask of them today, so long as they feel that you value their efforts. Say all the right things and push all the right buttons and chances are you won’t have to lift a finger yourself!|05-22-2014|leo
169|It may seem as if you have reached your limits or hit some kind of wall but don’t give up. There are plenty of people out there who will happily help you out but what you need to realize is they can’t read your mind. If you need help – ask!|05-23-2014|leo
170|Everyone has a talent, everyone was born with a special gift, and your aim now is to identify what it is you are really good at and make it the centerpiece of your life. Fame and fortune are yours for the taking – if you really want them.|05-24-2014|leo
171|Forget about doing things purely for yourself and try to do what benefits the world as a whole, or at least a wide range of people. What you need to remember is that what you do for others always comes back to you in the end.|05-25-2014|leo
172|There is so much you want to do in life but you are beginning to wonder if time and opportunity have passed you by. No they have not. It’s not really about time, it’s about motivation. What can you do now, this very minute? So do it!|05-26-2014|leo
173|Friendships and group activities are highlighted today and throughout the week, so don’t you dare spend all your time indoors. Get out into the world and mix with all sorts of people – every one of them will have something to teach you.|05-27-2014|leo
174|If you need advice of any sort today don’t be afraid to ask your friends what they think. The current new moon means they will help in any way they can, but you need to ask them first – they won’t just offer their opinions.|05-28-2014|leo
175|Your confidence will get a boost today and you will be a lot more relaxed about your social and professional status. One door may have closed to you but within a matter of days another door will open. Have the courage to walk through.|05-29-2014|leo
176|You seem to be endowed with almost limitless energy at the moment and are getting so much done that it’s unlikely you will let up any time soon. Remember though that in the long-term it is quality work that counts, not quantity.|05-30-2014|leo
177|You will get the chance to do something extraordinary this weekend and if you are smart you won’t let it pass you by. Get out there into the world and be dynamic, dramatic and daring. You’re a Leo – everyone expects you to be larger than life!|05-31-2014|leo
178|A short-term loss may be annoying but chances are it will become a long-term gain, so don’t fret too much. If you recently made some sort of agreement or pact with someone make sure you stick with it. If you don’t, your reputation will suffer.|06-01-2014|leo
179|A number of strange, even bizarre, thing are likely to happen over the next 24 hours but none of them can do you any harm so don’t take them too seriously. More to the point, try not to take yourself too seriously.|06-02-2014|leo
180|This is probably not a good time to commit yourself to a new plan or project. The Sun linked to Pluto, planet of power, means that certain people cannot be trusted, no matter how upbeat they may be about what you are doing together.|06-03-2014|leo
181|You need to raise your sights and pursue interests that are worthy of your time and your energy. What they may be should be a little clearer after today, so keep your eyes and ears open – and let your inner voice guide you.|06-04-2014|leo
182|Something will happen today that makes you wonder if you have been too hasty in reaching certain conclusions. Just because some people have a way of life that is radically different to your own does not make them mad or bad.|06-05-2014|leo
183|You will be on the receiving end of some criticism today but don’t overreact as that may make matters worse. Is there some truth in what they are saying about you? Everyone has faults – yes, even a Leo. Maybe you should listen and learn.|06-06-2014|leo
184|This may be a rather tense time for you but nothing bad is going to happen. Keep telling yourself there is nothing to worry about and keep your mind occupied so it does not have time to wander in negative directions.|06-07-2014|leo
185|Resist the urge to put your thoughts into words – if not you’ll cause the kind of storm that drenches everyone, including you. A few days from now the situation will have changed and criticism will be unnecessary, so bite your tongue.|06-08-2014|leo
186|You may find it difficult to control your temper today but that’s okay. Sometimes you need to let off steam and with Venus strong in your chart at the moment loved ones, work colleagues and even employers are likely to forgive you.|06-09-2014|leo
187|It would be nice if everyone was as enthusiastic about life as you are but it isn’t going to happen. All you can do, today and every day, is to live with a smile on your face and a song in your heart and be a wonderful example.|06-10-2014|leo
188|Much as you might like to help a friend or relative today if they give off signals that they want you to keep your distance then you must respect that. You will only make matters worse if you interfere where you’ve not been invited.|06-11-2014|leo
189|You may be tempted to push yourself even harder today, both physically and mentally, but is that such a good idea? You are already moving fast and living close to the edge – one wrong step could send you over the precipice.|06-12-2014|leo
190|The full moon could have you doing things and saying things that will cause problems of a romantic nature. Handle affairs of the heart with a great deal of care over the next 48 hours. Remember: others will take your words at face value.|06-13-2014|leo
191|You seem to believe that you can get away with anything at the moment but watch out you don’t get carried away and start believing you are untouchable. Be bold and be brave but don’t ever believe you are immune to life’s setbacks.|06-14-2014|leo
192|If you cut corners in any way, shape or form over the next few days you will be found out and the results are unlikely to be pleasant. People in positions of authority are watching you closely, so do everything by the book.|06-15-2014|leo
193|Be careful you don’t let slip any personal information today or you could find it being used against you by a rival. Sometimes you can be too trusting for your own good. Not everyone is as open and honest as you.|06-16-2014|leo
194|Others may be talking about you – and what they are saying is unlikely to be flattering – but what of it? You are big enough and bold enough to shrug it off and keep moving forward. At least you do things that are worth talking about!|06-17-2014|leo
195|Everything is going so well for you at the moment, to the extent that you are even prepared to forget long-running feuds with colleagues and relatives. Make the most of it as it’s unlikely to last, but while it does you’ll feel great.|06-18-2014|leo
196|People around you will be rather moody today, which in turn is sure to get you annoyed. Before the situation spirals out of control remind yourself that in the greater scheme of things it’s of little importance. Keep a sense of perspective.|06-19-2014|leo
197|If you play hard to get today you may send people the wrong sort of message. For one thing they may believe you no longer care, which of course isn’t true. Make yourself available, tiring though it may sometimes be.|06-20-2014|leo
198|Keep things in perspective and don’t let anything upset your emotional equilibrium. The Sun’s entry into the most sensitive area of your chart means this is a time for quiet reflection rather than robust action. Relax both your mind and your body.|06-21-2014|leo
199|You will have to make efforts above and beyond the call of duty over the next few days. There is, of course, a danger that you might exhaust yourself but it will be worth the effort in the long-term. Your future looks remarkably rosy.|06-22-2014|leo
200|Friendships are under excellent stars today, so if you are bored with your home life or your work seek out people who make you feel glad to be alive. There is nothing Leo likes more than being with people who are on the same wavelength.|06-23-2014|leo
201|Don’t worry too much about keeping things civil today. If you’ve got something to say then come right out with it and, if certain people don’t like it, too bad! You are under no obligation to be nice, especially to those who don’t deserve it.|06-24-2014|leo
202|Don’t keep your plans to yourself. Let others know what you intend to do and invite them to join in if they have something to offer. This is a great day for strengthening bonds that may have come a bit loose of late.|06-25-2014|leo
203|If there are any ill feelings between you and a loved one you must sort it out over the next 24 hours. Yes, they can at times be a pain. Yes, they can at times infuriate you. But bearing grudges is always self-defeating.|06-26-2014|leo
204|You have nothing to fear and everything to look forward to and the more you repeat that phrase to yourself today the more likely it is you will have a great time. Don’t forget: your guardian angel is always watching over you.|06-27-2014|leo
205|You seem to be lacking in purpose but what happens over the next two or three days will give you a target to aim for again. Creatively and artistically you need to look for more up-to-date ways to express yourself.|06-28-2014|leo
206|Have faith in your abilities and don’t be afraid to take on new responsibilities. Mercury, planet of the mind, moves in your favor this week, so you should find it easy to inspire yourself. What can you do? Anything and everything.|06-29-2014|leo
207|If you join forces with like-minded people over the next two or three days you will accomplish something remarkable. It may not be possible for one lone individual to change the world but many minds and hands working together can do it.|06-30-2014|leo
208|It may annoy you that others are dithering over what should be a simple decision but try not to let your anger show. If you do it will encourage them to drag their feet even more and your blood pressure may not be able to stand it!|07-01-2014|leo
209|Find a quiet place where you can be alone with your thoughts and start asking some serious questions of the “who am I?” and “what should I be doing with my life?” variety. Your mind will bring up answers that surprise you.|07-02-2014|leo
210|Something will occur over the next 24 hours that makes you want to let the world know what a passionate human being you can be. The only danger is that you will come on too strong and frighten that special someone away.|07-03-2014|leo
211|Yes, of course, you have a right to say what you think but don’t forget that others have the right to hit back if they so choose. If you clash with someone whose ideas are at odds with your own there could be fireworks today.|07-04-2014|leo
212|The planets warn there is a danger that you will try to force an issue that should be left to work itself out and with the emotional Moon and aggressive Mars both strong this weekend that could be disastrous. Learn to leave things alone.|07-05-2014|leo
213|You will help those who need help more in the long-term if you leave well alone now. People progress quicker by making mistakes and once you recognize that fact you won’t be so eager to interfere. Everything will work out for the best in the end.|07-06-2014|leo
214|You may be tempted to let a rival off the hook today but the planets warn that may not be a good idea, if only because it is likely to encourage others to take advantage of you too. Be ruthless and make an example of them.|07-07-2014|leo
215|You are supposed to be bold. You are supposed to be courageous. So what happened? It’s the Sun’s transit of the most sensitive area of your chart that is to blame – you just can’t face the world at the moment. That’s okay – you don’t have to.|07-08-2014|leo
216|Be creative today. Try something you have not tried before. The Sun’s link with Saturn, planet of success, indicates that if you make an effort you will accomplish something out of the ordinary – something that might even make you famous.|07-09-2014|leo
217|You love your freedom but you have responsibilities like everyone else and over the next few days you will have to knuckle down and do your duty. Social activities will have to take second place for a while but you’ll make up for it later.|07-10-2014|leo
218|What happens today will remind you that sometimes the old way of doing things is best. Fortunately, you have never been one to slavishly follow the latest trend or fashion so it’s unlikely the lesson will be a hard one – for you at least.|07-11-2014|leo
219|Resist the urge to push yourself hard over the next 48 hours because you are not as strong physically as you seem to believe. Your powers of recovery may be remarkable but you have limits like everyone else. Know them and respect them.|07-12-2014|leo
220|You will be feeling at one with the world over the next few days, thanks to the beneficial effect of Jupiter moving into your sign. The only danger is that you could become a bit too laid-back and let others take advantage of you.|07-13-2014|leo
221|The more others say you should be disciplined and respectful of tradition the more you will go out of your way to be rebellious. There is no logical reason why you should follow the rules just because other people say you must.|07-14-2014|leo
222|Jupiter, planet of good fortune, is heading rapidly for your birth sign, so stop worrying about all the things that could go wrong in your life and start looking forward to all the things that will surely go right there’s so many of them.|07-15-2014|leo
223|You have done many things over the past few weeks, some of them good and some of them bad but all of them because you believed in what you were doing. Because of that you have no reason to apologize – not that you were going to anyway!|07-16-2014|leo
224|Someone has been taking liberties and you need to confront them about it. If you leave it much longer they may get the impression that they can take from you as and when they please – and that could lead to major problems.|07-17-2014|leo
225|Like everyone else you have weaknesses and the planets warn that one of them – pride most likely – could be your undoing. Just because everything is going so well for you now does not mean you can let down your guard.|07-18-2014|leo
226|Think carefully before rejecting an attractive offer simply because you will have to pay for it in some way. If something is worth having it is worth making sacrifices for, so weigh up the pros and cons and then make your move.|07-19-2014|leo
227|The Sun joins Jupiter in your birth sign on Tuesday, after which you will have the world at your feet. The next few weeks are going to be truly special and, being a Leo, you don’t need to be told to enjoy every moment.|07-20-2014|leo
228|The more time you spend trying to work out what might go wrong over the next few days the less time you will have for making things go right, and that would be a shame. Worry is, was and always will be a useless emotion.|07-21-2014|leo
229|The time has come to stop hiding your talents and to show the worldwhat you can do. The Sun’s move into your birth sign today kicks off a new solar year and inspires you to pursue excellence in everything you do. Be amazing.|07-22-2014|leo
230|The most important thing now is that you keep reminding yourself that all things are possible. The simple fact is that you alone create the path you take through life and you alone are responsible for it. You are destined to accomplish great things.|07-23-2014|leo
231|Jupiter, planet of good fortune, will make the coming year one of the very best times of your life. What you make of your opportunities is up to you but, looking back, you won’t be able to complain you never had any. The fact is, you’ve got it all.|07-24-2014|leo
232|Most of the time you don’t think too deeply about the meaning of life but this year you will be looking for answers to the bigger questions. Join with people who share your desire to go beyond the mundane. Together you’ll make magical discoveries.|07-25-2014|leo
233|By all means assert yourself and be creative but do so in a way that does not alienate other people. It’s your life and you are entitled to do with it what you see fit but try to see how other people, especially those you love, might be affected by your actions.|07-26-2014|leo
234|Use your imagination. Try to visualize where you want to be 12 months from now and what you want to have accomplished between now and then. Your mind is a powerful tool and the more you imagine something the more likely it is to become a reality.|07-27-2014|leo
235|Treat people fairly this week, even if they don’t deserve it. Just because they have broken the rules does not mean you must do likewise. On the contrary, this is a chance to show that you are the kind of person who always puts principles first.|07-28-2014|leo
236|Someone you meet will inspire you to do more and do better. It’s good that you have a role model to look up to but don’t try to copy who they are in every way. Let your own unique talents and personality come through. Others will soon be inspired by you.|07-29-2014|leo
237|There will be times this year when you could easily pack it all in and head off to where the pressures are not so great – but running away is not the answer. Forget about long-term goals and focus on taking that single next step. You’ll get there in the end.|07-30-2014|leo
238|Forget about what might have been: the past is of no concern. The only thing that matters now is the future. Take each day as it comes and don’t bother looking too far ahead. Your life will always be guided in the right direction.|07-31-2014|leo
239|Your generosity knows no bounds and over the coming 12 months you will go out of your way to make sure that friends and family members have everything they desire. But what is it you desire? There’s no reason why you should not have that as well.|08-01-2014|leo
240|You won’t be short of opinions this year and you won’t hesitate to let everyone within earshot know all about them. Let others get a word in edgeways occasionally as you are not the only one with good ideas. Communication must be a two-way street.|08-02-2014|leo
241|The opportunities that come your way over the next 12 months – and there will be plenty – will require you to move in directions you may never have moved in before. That’s good. Either life is a great adventure or it is nothing. Discover new lands.|08-03-2014|leo
242|There is so much doom and disaster talk around at the moment and it’s getting you down but you don’t have to let it get to you. Strive to be positive over the coming 12 months. Look at life as a wonderful adventure, not as something you should try avoid.|08-04-2014|leo
243|Today’s cosmic influences will help you to view the world with eyes that see deeper and farther than most other people. What you discover will astound and delight you. The world is not only a beautiful place, it has meaning too.|08-05-2014|leo
244|You will have to deal with someone who gets emotional for no good reason. They may be in floods of tears but you must stay dry eyed and focus on what needs to be done. Be sensitive to what is worrying them but be practical too.|08-06-2014|leo
245|Mars and Neptune combine on your birthday in a way that demands you use your imagination more. There is so much you can give to the world creatively and, with the success it brings, so much you can enjoy, personally, professionally and financially.|08-07-2014|leo
246|The planets will give a major boost to your self-belief over the next 24 hours (do you really need it?) and before the day is over you will have started something that has the potential to transform your life. Trust what your heart tells you.|08-08-2014|leo
247|The Sun links with Uranus, planet of changes, on your birthday so strange things will happen over the coming 12 months. But every last one of them will be a good thing too, so be positive and don’t be afraid to tear down the past. It’s the future that matters.|08-09-2014|leo
248|A full moon in your opposite sign is sure to stir up rivalries and there may be a few harsh words going back and forth. That’s okay, it’s all good knockabout stuff and you are not the sort to bear a grudge. It’s all part of the game.|08-10-2014|leo
249|The next 12 months could be the most important of your life. No matter how many times in the past you have criticized yourself for not being more active or ambitious you can make up for them all over the coming year. There’s still time to be amazing.|08-11-2014|leo
250|If there are things you still need to do, things that you might not get the chance to do later on, get working on them today. You could leave them until tomorrow but by then there will be other issues that demand your time and attention.|08-12-2014|leo
251|You cannot go on working your fingers to the bone, especially when most of the rewards go to colleagues and employers. The message of your birthday chart is that you need to cut back on what you do for others – and do much more for yourself.|08-13-2014|leo
252|The more you are put to the test over the coming year the more you will like it. No matter how many challenges you have to face you will overcome them all with ease. You have always known you are the best – now you can go out and prove it.|08-14-2014|leo
253|Either you commit yourself fully to a task or project of some kind over the coming 12 months or you forget about it altogether. For too long it has been neither one thing nor the other, so get serious and, most importantly, live happily with the choice you make.|08-15-2014|leo
254|Both in your personal life and at work others will pick holes in your performance over the next few days, but it’s really no big deal. Your ego is big enough to handle it and, if necessary, hit back at them if it gets too much.|08-16-2014|leo
255|How you choose to look at life has a huge effect on what kind of life you experience. With that fact in mind why not resolve to be positive at all times and in all situations over the coming year? View it as an experiment. See if it makes a difference. It will.|08-17-2014|leo
256|Venus links with Jupiter, planet of good fortune, in your sign, making it easy to attract the things you need into your life. All things are possible now, but one thing matters above all others. You know what it is, so make it your priority.|08-18-2014|leo
257|Your mind is overflowing with big ideas and you can’t wait to get started on them. But the planets warn it might be wise to hold back a bit. Could be an even better opportunity is heading your way. Don’t miss it.|08-19-2014|leo
258|Too often of late you have chased dreams that other people have set for you when you should have been chasing the one dream that means something to you. The message of the stars on your birthday is to just be yourself. You can still make your dream a reality.|08-20-2014|leo
259|You will have plenty to say for yourself over the coming 12 months but it will be what you leave unsaid that has the most positive impact. Every time you are tempted to criticize others try to check yourself and say something inspiring instead.|08-21-2014|leo
260|Do you regret that you did not take a different path through life? Well don’t. Not only is it a waste of time but chances are it wasn’t the wrong path at all. According to the planets your experiences were all for a reason. The path you’re on is right for you.|08-22-2014|leo
261|There will be all sorts of distractions going on around you over the coming year but you will ignore each and every one of them. There are two keys to success: knowing what you want and being totally committed to getting it. You can’t possibly fail.|08-23-2014|leo
262|You will get at least one, and maybe several, opportunities to boost your income over the next few days. A new job is possible but just as likely is getting more money for what you already do. Don’t be afraid to ask for a raise.|08-24-2014|leo
263|You need to cut through the fog of misinformation and get to the root of whatever problem it is that is bothering you. Most likely you will find it is no problem at all, just something that requires a slightly off-center solution.|08-26-2014|leo
264|You want to get on in the world but you also need to set aside time to relax and unwind and be with your family and friends. Forget about work over the next 24 hours – do only what makes you feel good.|08-27-2014|leo
265|You may fall out with someone you live or work with today but nothing bad is likely to come of it. Whose fault it was in the first place is unimportant – what matters is that you come to your senses and move on together.|08-28-2014|leo
266|Life will confront you with a series of challenges that would have most people running for cover. But you’re made of tougher stuff. Amazingly, you will actually rather enjoy being put to the test – it gives you the chance to prove yourself.|08-29-2014|leo
267|There will be more than one occasion this weekend when you come close to blowing your top. Hopefully you won’t go that far because, if you do, you may say something you later regret. Hold your breath and count slowly to ten.|08-30-2014|leo
268|Don’t let financial considerations play any part in what you are planning to do this coming week. By Tuesday at the latest you will realize that something you have been obsessing over is really not worth the worry. It never is.|08-31-2014|leo
269|Let others know what is on your mind. If you keep your thoughts to yourself much longer they will start to eat at you and you may be in for a sleepless night or three, so speak up and see what kind of a reaction you get.|09-01-2014|leo
270|Start aiming higher, both in your personal life and at work. So many times in the past you’ve had chances to do something special but for one reason or another you failed to get started. Now you must, because it may be now or never.|09-02-2014|leo
271|You need to request a favor of someone and because you are not sure what their reaction will be you are not looking forward to the experience. Don’t worry. Whatever it is you need they will give it to you no questions asked.|09-03-2014|leo
272|You are doing more than enough as it is, both in your personal life and at work, so if someone asks you to help out today find a way to say “no”. The last thing you need now is to be taking on even more chores and responsibilities.|09-04-2014|leo
273|If you need to approach someone for financial assistance then do so this weekend, but don’t automatically assume they know what it is you want. Chances are they are completely unaware of your troubles, so spell it out for them.|09-05-2014|leo
274|You may want certain things to stay as they are, to never change, but you should know by now that everything changes in the end. Stop trying to hold on to the past and reach out to the future in all its unpredictable glory.|09-06-2014|leo
275|The choice you are faced with this coming week is simple: do you listen to your conscience or do you let greed be your guide? You know what you should do, of course, but your lower nature won’t make it easy for you.|09-07-2014|leo
276|You may be shocked by what you see or hear over the next 24 hours but you are strongly advised to mind your own business. Yes, from your point of view it seems wrong, but there are other ways of looking at the situation.|09-08-2014|leo
277|Some people delight in getting ahead at other people’s expense and you are likely to encounter one such individual today. All you can do is keep your wits about you and not be taken in by offers that sound too good to be true.|09-09-2014|leo
278|With Neptune, planet of illusion, up to its tricks today you could easily make a foolish mistake – and if you do it’s unlikely others will be able to get you out of trouble. Know your limits and don’t be tempted to go beyond them.|09-10-2014|leo
279|It may seems as if everyone else has been out and about and having fun while you’ve been stuck at home or at work but don’t sweat it. Your turn will come, and soon, so keep doing what you’re doing – and doing it well.|09-11-2014|leo
280|Any bad feelings you have about a career or creative move you are planning to make will disappear over the next 24 hours. You should know by now that the only thing worth fearing is fear itself. Whatever it is that inspires you, just do it.|09-12-2014|leo
281|One of the best times for getting things done begins today as Mars moves into the most creative area of your chart. Never mind that you have tried and failed before, what matters is that you WILL succeed now – IF you get started!|09-13-2014|leo
282|It may feel as if your luck will last forever but the planets warn the hand of fate won’t always be working in your favor over the next seven days. Make sure you have a back-up plan, especially if there is money at stake. |09-14-2014|leo
283|You can sense that something is wrong and you know better than to ignore your instincts. Where both personal and career issues are concerned don’t wait to see how things develop – take the initiative and act immediately on your suspicions.|09-15-2014|leo
284|A more light-hearted approach is called for today, especially if you are the sort of Leo who tends to get uptight about things over which you have no control. Whether you laugh or whether you cry the final outcome will be the same. So laugh.|09-16-2014|leo
285|The successes and triumphs of recent weeks could still easily be reversed, so don’t start thinking you have cracked it and no longer need to make an effort. You’ve come so far and achieved so much – don’t slow down just before the line.|09-17-2014|leo
286|You have been held back too long and are desperate to spread your wings. You will get the chance not long after the Sun changes signs on the 23rd. but for now stay where you are and, most importantly, finish what you started.|09-18-2014|leo
287|However difficult your current situation may be you will handle it with ease. What you need to realize is that whatever you have to face, today or any other day, is what you are meant to face. On the cosmic level it’s all good.|09-19-2014|leo
288|There will be times over the next 48 hours when you feel as if you are the only one who does not know what’s going on. Maybe that’s true, but even if it is it really doesn’t matter. Everything will change next week, so why worry?|09-20-2014|leo
289|The planets warn you could lose out financially if you say something rash this week. You are entitled to your opinions, of course, but maybe you should keep them to yourself for the next 48 hours. After that you can say what you please.|09-21-2014|leo
290|You may fear losing something you have grown attached to but if it’s got to go it’s got to go and there is nothing you can do about it. You can save a lot of heartache by letting go now rather than hanging on until the very last moment.|09-22-2014|leo
291|If you have done something you are proud of then by all means shout about it and let everyone know. No doubt there will be one or two people who find it hard to hide their jealousy but your true friends will be delighted for you.|09-23-2014|leo
292|Try not to react in an emotional way to what is basically a practical problem. Today’s new moon will bring positive signs that you are moving in the right direction at last but you must make sure your head rules your heart.|09-24-2014|leo
293|Something you said a while back was taken out of context and a rival is now using it against you. Set the record straight today. They need to be reminded that no one, but no one, gets the better of Leo – not now, not ever.|09-25-2014|leo
294|Don’t think about all the bad things that go on in the world – think about how you personally can make it a better place in some small way. What is your special talent? How can you use it to make people smile? Get to it!|09-26-2014|leo
295|What happens this weekend may catch you unawares but looking back you will have to admit that the signs have been there for quite a while – you just chose to ignore them. Now though you have no choice but to act. Be decisive.|09-27-2014|leo
296|You may have a long, hard slog ahead of you before you reach your final destination but the planets will endow you with plenty of energy over the coming week. Use it wisely and you will soon be taking giant steps to success.|09-28-2014|leo
297|Let fate take its course over the next two or three days and don’t try to force an issue that will most likely resolve itself. Too often of late by trying to solve one type of problem you have accidentally created another, so leave well alone.|09-29-2014|leo
298|Why are you worrying so much about what might go wrong when just about everything in your life is going right at the moment? Maybe that’s the problem – maybe you fear your lucky streak is a mistake and will end soon. No it won’t.|09-30-2014|leo
299|If you need to take stock of your money situation this would be a good time. However, don’t get so caught up in dollars and cents that you view everything as either profit or loss. You can’t put a cash value on fun or on love.|10-01-2014|leo
300|Not all change is disruptive – sometimes it can be the best possible thing to happen. Bear that thought in mind today if you feel that things are moving a bit too fast. Before the week is out it won’t be fast enough for you.|10-02-2014|leo
301|Don’t waste time worrying that what you have to say might make you unpopular – say it loud and get it over with. You have an important message to convey and personal feelings cannot be allowed to get in the way.|10-03-2014|leo
302|Take extra care this week if you are on the move – and watch what you say too. Wednesday’s lunar eclipse means that others are likely to be more touchy than usual and minor disputes could easily escalate into major confrontations.|10-05-2014|leo
303|Travel and all forms of communication are highlighted over the next seven days, so make sure you plan your comings and goings well and make sure you let others know where you are off to and why. Don’t leave anything to chance.|10-06-2014|leo
304|According to the planets you are trying too hard. What you need to do now is to sit back for a while and let life come to you. Beyond a certain level more effort becomes self-defeating and you are way beyond that level already.|10-07-2014|leo
305|Don’t be afraid to rock the boat a bit today – in fact, rock it a lot. You don’t have to be aggressive but you do have to be assertive and you do need to let others know that, no matter how much they disagree, you will do your own thing.|10-08-2014|leo
306|Others may be willing to listen to your opinions today – they may even be impressed by them – but will they act on what you suggest? Probably not. Don’t worry too much about that, just make sure you live up to your own ideals.|10-09-2014|leo
307|You have been experiencing a lot of emotional ups and downs of late and need to find a balance between being concerned about personal issues and laughing at them. The many good things in your life will cancel out the one or two bad things.|10-10-2014|leo
308|You are in the enviable position of being able to ignore the kind of issues that other people are finding it difficult to cope with. Use the time it frees up to get on top of your workload, then get going on a new plan or project.|10-11-2014|leo
309|You have so much energy at your disposal but are you making the best possible use of it? Probably not. The coming week will bring new opportunities to be creative and original, both in your personal life and at work. Don’t you dare waste them! |10-12-2014|leo
310|You may not be as energetic as you would like to be as the new week begins but maybe that is no bad thing. Sit back today and watch the world go by. Sooner or later the opportunity you have been waiting for will come your way.|10-13-2014|leo
311|Try not to take life quite so seriously over the next 24 hours. You may still be anxious about certain issues but with Jupiter in your sign linked to values planet Venus today you can be confident it will all come good in the end.|10-14-2014|leo
312|You may not be that interested in what family and friends are up to today but you should get involved anyway. Today’s Sun-Mars link means it will be more fun than you bargained for. It could even give your love life a boost!|10-15-2014|leo
313|Okay, so your words have been misrepresented, but you don’t have to kick up a fuss about it. Just explain, in plain and simple language, what it is that has upset you so. Most likely it was an honest mistake and can easily be corrected.|10-16-2014|leo
314|Make an effort to get on top of your workload before the weekend begins. There is so much going on socially at the moment that it would be a shame to miss out because you have fallen behind on your must-do tasks list.|10-17-2014|leo
315|It will help if you take a more laidback approach to domestic issues over the next few days. The solar eclipse in midweek makes that the perfect time to let loved ones know you don’t hold grudges – in fact you find it all rather amusing.|10-19-2014|leo
316|You can be brutally honest at times and with communications planet Mercury linked to Jupiter, planet of excess, today there is every likelihood you will say something that shocks those around you. Good. They need shaking up.|10-20-2014|leo
317|You know what needs to be done and you know it must be done now. You have been working up to this moment for weeks, months, maybe even years, so get your act together and get moving – and once you are moving don’t stop.|10-21-2014|leo
318|If you take notice of the way certain people are acting it will be obvious what needs to be done to resolve whatever problems there are between you. It is not a question of you being right and them being wrong, or vice-versa – you’re just different, that’s all.|10-22-2014|leo
319|You need to be alert and you need to be willing to take a risk or two if you are to benefit from the changes taking place around you. You will also need to be less thin-skinned than usual as some people can’t help but be critical.|10-23-2014|leo
320|There may be some irritating things going on at the moment but don’t overreact. A loved one is not behaving badly because it is their nature but because they need time alone. Leave them be for a while – and stop trying to cheer them up.|10-24-2014|leo
321|Stop feeling sorry for yourself and redouble your efforts. You of all people should be aware that we only get out of life what we are prepared to put in, so put in what you can and sooner or later your efforts are sure to be rewarded.|10-25-2014|leo
322|You may want to be certain about something before you act but the planets insist that you put doubts behind you and act decisively. Listen to what your inner voice tells you. It may not seem logical but deep down you know it is right.|10-26-2014|leo
323|Why do you fear that time is passing you by? Why do you fear that if you don’t act now you will never get another chance. You will always get another chance, and another and another after that, so lighten up and live in the moment.|10-27-2014|leo
324|A sudden insight into a money issue will convince you there is nothing to get worked up about. But others won’t be so lucky and will be running about like the proverbial headless chickens. Do what you can to calm them down.|10-28-2014|leo
325|Don’t get uptight if things don’t go the way you want them to go. The best way to deal with challenges is to meet them head on, to place yourself in a situation where you are forced to find a solution. You are tougher than you think.|10-29-2014|leo
326|Everything in life has a meaning but sometimes it can be hard to see how it all fits together. You may not get the results you expected today but don’t worry – in the greater scheme of things you are making substantial progress.|10-30-2014|leo
327|You have put a great deal of effort into making a relationship work and you have no intention of letting it fail. With that in mind make sure you don’t overreact in midweek if certain people start behaving strangely. It’s no big deal.|11-02-2014|leo
328|The Sun and Pluto link well as the new week begins and the message it has for you is that you need to find more harmonious ways to link your home life and your work life. Changes are needed to restore some sort of balance. |11-03-2014|leo
329|You need to find a better balance between your home life and your work life. Loved ones will give you the support you need but only if you are prepared to find time in your busy schedule to ease their doubts and fears.|11-04-2014|leo
330|Certain areas of your private life may be chaotic but that is no reason why you should want to change everything. Focus on one task at a time today and don’t let domestic worries, in particular, detract from equally important issues. |11-05-2014|leo
331|If you find yourself under attack from a friend or colleague today, ask yourself why they are so angry with you. Could it be you have failed to live up to your side of a bargain of some sort? If so, apologize and make amends.|11-06-2014|leo
332|You need to be a bit more open-minded than you usually are. Why? Because a loved one is committed to a certain course of action and, whether you like it or not, they are going to see it through to the end. Support them 100 per cent.|11-07-2014|leo
333|You must remain objective about an issue that has the potential to cause problems. The last thing you want is to be dragged into the kind of emotional showdown from which no one escapes unscathed. This is the worst possible time to choose sides.|11-08-2014|leo
334|Don’t waste time lamenting the chances you have wasted – they are now in the past and should be forgotten. What matters now is that you resolve to take advantage of the next opportunity which comes your way. Here it comes now. |11-09-2014|leo
335|If you try to play mind games with other people today you could find your tactics backfire on you. To you it may be a bit of fun but some people are passionate about their beliefs and if you antagonize them you are asking for trouble.|11-10-2014|leo
336|You will have to deal with someone you don’t much like today but there does not have to be conflict. You can easily avoid a confrontation if you keep your wits about you. Be witty too – laughter always brings people together. |11-11-2014|leo
337|You worry that you are being forced to move in a certain direction, a direction you don’t want to go. In which case you have no alternative but to dig in your heels and refuse to budge another inch. It’s your life – take control of it.|11-12-2014|leo
338|There will be several heart-warming moments today but don’t let them detract from other important matters. A new relationship may be a lot of fun but family and financial issues have to be dealt with too – and dealt with quickly.|11-13-2014|leo
339|The message of the stars today is that it’s a waste of time to worry – about anything but especially about money. A financial matter must be left to run its course. Maybe you could have done more to influence the outcome but it’s too late now.|11-14-2014|leo
340|Your social life will be amazing over the next 48 hours. And with Venus moving into the most dynamic area of your chart there could be a new love interest too. You will certainly be ridiculously attractive – like usual, only more so by far!|11-15-2014|leo
341|Even if you fear that you might hurt a loved one’s feelings you must tell the truth. The planets indicate that, like it or not, it is your responsibility to reveal some rather disturbing information. Say it tactfully, but also as if you mean it.|11-16-2014|leo
342|Never be afraid of your feelings, even when they are negative in nature. If you are annoyed about something there must be a reason for it. In the long-term you may choose to forgive and forget but by all means get angry today.  |11-17-2014|leo
343|You have so many good ideas but for some reason you are reluctant to do much with them. Something you think of today has the potential to transform your existence, but only if you have more confidence in yourself as an ideas person.|11-18-2014|leo
344|If you apply a small amount of pressure in the right place today you will accomplish something huge. Act as if you have total self-belief – even when you don’t – and others will be so intimidated they will help rather than hinder your efforts. |11-19-2014|leo
345|No matter how difficult it has been resolving a dispute today’s cosmic picture will help you find the perfect compromise. You may have to give a little more ground than you expected but it should not be a massive blow to your pride.|11-20-2014|leo
346|It may annoy you that a friend keeps saying one thing while doing the opposite but don’t let your anger show. The best approach is to pretend it does not bother you, while making secret plans to remove yourself from their presence. |11-21-2014|leo
347|No secrets are safe when you are around – you have a knack for sniffing out details that others would prefer the world not to know. Not that you intend to tell everyone – knowledge is power only when you are the one who possesses it. |11-22-2014|leo
348|If you make the effort to understand something that does not naturally appeal to you there is a good chance you will discover it has a hidden charm. Maybe you should be a little more open-minded about things you don’t understand.|11-23-2014|leo
349|What you want to do and what you are expected to do may be different things but if you are smart you will find ways to combine duty and pleasure. Do you enjoy what you do, or do you do what you enjoy? Do both!  |11-24-2014|leo
350|You like to be free to do things on the spur of the moment and nothing will stop you from following your instincts over the next 24 hours. Just make sure you don’t go too far and follow them to a place you cannot get back from! |11-25-2014|leo
351|The main thing to remember today is that a loved one does not mean the negative things they have been saying. Like you they are under a lot of pressure at the moment and that inevitably affects the way they speak and act. |11-26-2014|leo
352|Make a wish today, because there is every chance it will come true. You may not get what you want immediately but the planets indicate that by the start of next week you will see a major, and better, change to your fortunes.|11-27-2014|leo
353|If a friend or work colleague asks you to do something you believe is unethical you must refuse, even if you feel you owe them a favor. The best favor you can do them by far is pointing out why they need to rethink their attitude.|11-28-2014|leo
354|The Sun in Sagittarius will provide you with new openings and opportunities and all you have to do is take advantage of them. Creatively this is a wonderful time of year for you, so be bold and make a start on that big project you’ve been planning.  |11-29-2014|leo
355|Over the next few days you will get the opportunity to put right something that has been wrong for months, maybe years. You may have to act in a provocative manner when Mars changes signs on Thursday but it’s in a good cause.|11-30-2014|leo
356|Now is the time to get started on a task you have been avoiding. With Mars and Saturn on good terms today you will find it easy to concentrate and before you know it the job will be done. Then it’s on to the fun stuff. |12-01-2014|leo
357|You don’t have to be nice for the sake of it, and you certainly don’t have to be nice if you feel that someone is trying to hustle you. The planets indicate that the best way to protect yourself is to go on the attack. Not tomorrow – now!  |12-02-2014|leo
358|The best way to deal with a money worry is to ignore it completely. Focus your mind on partnerships instead and you will find there is plenty to be positive about. A romantic relationship is about to enter a more passionate phase.|12-03-2014|leo
359|You can perform an important service for a work colleague today, a service that will put them in your debt. You will help them out of the kindness of your heart, of course, but it’s nice to know you can call on a favor in return. |12-04-2014|leo
360|You may be easygoing by nature but the approaching full moon warns you need to stay sharp over the next 48 hours. Also, don’t say things just to make others feel good – be true to yourself and express what you really believe. |12-05-2014|leo
361|The reason you have not been getting along with a certain person is because you have been trying too hard to impress them. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? You’re a Leo which, among other things, means they should try to impress you!|12-06-2014|leo
362|As Jupiter turns retrograde in your sign on Monday you must do things strictly by the book. There are certain rules and regulations that must be followed and if you try to cut corners you could upset some very important people. Not good.|12-07-2014|leo
363|There are so many cosmic influences working in your favor now that you can’t help but feel delighted with life. However, as luck planet Jupiter turns retrograde in your sign today don’t take too much for granted. Circumstances can change fast.|12-08-2014|leo
364|Be enthusiastic about what you have to do today. Even if it is the last thing you want to be doing you have no choice but to see it through to the end, so you might as well enjoy it. Find ways to get inspired. |12-09-2014|leo
365|You have so many good ideas swirling around inside your head but how many of them will amount to anything? If you are not sure which of your ideas have selling potential don’t be afraid to ask someone who is likely to know.|12-10-2014|leo
366|Put your own needs first today and don’t feel in the least bit guilty about it. Some people may say you are selfish, and maybe you are, but what of it? You have desires like everyone else – and every right to satisfy them. |12-11-2014|leo
367|Use your time and energy wisely today. It does not matter how much work you have to get through before the weekend you must not finish what you have to do too quickly. Get it right the first time, no matter how long it takes.|12-12-2014|leo
368|If you have secret feelings for someone you are advised to keep them a secret, at least for the time being. Most likely they feel the same way about you but both of you have other duties to take care of this weekend.|12-13-2014|leo
369|Someone you don’t much like will rub you up the wrong way in a big way this week. Will you lose your temper? Of course you will and you are right to do so. Once they see how angry you are they will stay out of your way.|12-14-2014|leo
370|If someone annoys you over the next two or three days they are sure to regret it. You are in no mood to turn away from trouble or turn the other cheek, in fact you will go out of your way to even the scores. Watch out world!|12-15-2014|leo
371|If you give the impression that you are anxious for success you could attract the attention of those who know how to play on your greed. Also, watch out your ego does not mislead you. Sometimes you can be a bit too sure of yourself.|12-16-2014|leo
372|You seem to be in one of your upbeat moods at the moment, which is great, but the planets warn you could be a bit too optimistic for your own good. Remember, if you start something new you must see it through to the end.|12-17-2014|leo
373|Let matters develop at their own pace today, especially on the work front where things are moving so fast that there is no point in trying to change them. Just keep an eye on what happens and be ready to act when the time is right. |12-18-2014|leo
374|Someone in a position of authority will flex their muscles and demand that you do things you don’t want to do. Go along with what they want for now but start making plans to put some distance between you early in the new year.|12-19-2014|leo
375|Take care of yourself this weekend, especially if you have been burning the candle at both ends again. The planets indicate that you need a rest after the feverish activity of recent weeks. Nothing is more important than your health. |12-20-2014|leo
376|Tomorrow’s new moon will in some way or other encourage you to improve your techniques and procedures. They may have worked for you up until now but time waits for no one and if you want to stay relevant you’ve got to move on.|12-21-2014|leo
377|You need to break free of routines and habits that hold you back from realizing your potential and today’s new moon will help. Forget about the little things and look at the big picture over the next 24 hours. There’s a good chance you will like what you see. |12-22-2014|leo
378|A breakthrough of some sort is about to occur and come the start of the new year you will be milking the applause. Your rivals may say you have been lucky but luck has nothing to do with it – you just worked harder than they did. |12-23-2014|leo
379|Try to build bridges to people you don’t always get along with. Just because you have different outlooks on life does not mean you cannot be friends, or at least friendly acquaintances. Strangely, opposites often work well together. |12-24-2014|leo
380|Yesterday you were quiet and reserved. Today you are partying as if there is no tomorrow. Only a Leo can go from one extreme to the other so easily and so quickly. What will you be doing tomorrow? Recovering most likely! |12-25-2014|leo
381|If someone in a position of authority wants you to do something for them today then most likely you will have no choice in the matter. You can however choose how good a job you do. Make it the best thing you’ve ever done. |12-26-2014|leo
382|Difficult decisions will be easier to make over the next 48 hours. In fact, what seemed such a hard call yesterday won’t seem in the least bit difficult today, a sure sign that your outlook has changed for the better. |12-27-2014|leo
383|Try not to work too hard over the next two or three days or you may have to take an extended break early in the new year. Map out a gentle schedule and stick to it no matter how much others may try to make you do more.|12-28-2014|leo
384|According to the planets you have precious little to worry about but you may have to trick your mind into believing that is so. Focus only on good things over the next 24 hours – and good things will be more likely to happen.|12-29-2014|leo
385|If you find yourself being nudged in a new direction over the next few days don’t try to resist. Despite what some people might tell you anything and everything is possible for you now, so start the new year with total self-belief. |12-30-2014|leo
386|You don’t have to work harder and longer to get something completed before the new year begins. There is no reason why you should work yourself into the ground just because you are falling behind. You’ll catch up – you always do.|12-31-2014|leo
387|Partnership matters will go well in the opening days of the new year and they will go even better if you stop trying to be the boss and treat friends, relatives and loved ones as equals. You don’t actually have to believe they are though. |01-01-2015|leo
388|The next couple of days will be challenging, especially on the work front where events beyond your control will frustrate you and make you start thinking that you might be happier elsewhere. Maybe this is the wake-up call you need. |01-02-2015|leo
389|Whatever fights and feuds you’ve had with partners and work colleagues and loved ones in recent weeks put them behind you now and get on with your life. Forgive and forget and move on – not for their benefit but for your own. |01-03-2015|leo
390|Stop worrying about work issues and focus on having a good time. Affairs of the heart are well starred at the moment and with one special person you are sure to be flavor of the month, for a day or two at least.|01-04-2015|leo
391|If you think you have to come first or be best at everything you may end up exhausted. Cosmic activity in the wellbeing area of your chart urges you to recognize that the important thing is not the winning but the taking part.|01-05-2015|leo
392|Dealing with other people’s problems will take up a large slice of your time today and while it may be a bore it will also put you in the good books of people whose help you may need in the future. Good deeds are always repaid.|01-06-2015|leo
393|Form a picture in your mind of where you would like to be a year from now and then start doing the things that will make it happen. All things are possible but you still need to look and plan ahead. |01-07-2015|leo
394|If you find yourself arguing with someone over a contentious issue today you must stick closely to the facts. If you try to bend the truth in any way, shape or form they will find out and it will most likely ruin your case. |01-08-2015|leo
395|Take no notice if a friend or work colleague tries to terrify you with tales of what might go wrong. According to the planets most things will go your way over the next 24 hours and the few things that don’t can’t hurt you. |01-09-2015|leo
396|It’s okay to play down differences and find ways to compromise but don’t go too far and give others the impression that you are weak. If you want peace and quiet this weekend you may have to kick up a fuss to get it.|01-10-2015|leo
397|As Mars moves into one of the more intense areas of your chart on Monday it’s quite likely you will be suspicious of certain people for no good reason. Yes, maybe they are after your money, but more likely you are imagining things.|01-11-2015|leo
398|You need to think long-term rather than merely aim for short-term gain. That applies in particular to business and professional matters. Forget about making a quick buck – the more you plan ahead the better off you will eventually be. |01-12-2015|leo
399|You may be tempted to get involved with something that appeals to your adventurous nature but can you be sure it will work out okay? No you can’t is the answer to that one, but if you knew it would then it wouldn’t be so much fun! |01-13-2015|leo
400|You are advised not to take money issues too seriously today, not because they don’t matter but because you may well be looking at them from completely the wrong angle. You won’t lose anything by biding your time. You may even gain.|01-14-2015|leo
401|If someone annoys you today – and chances are they will – you won’t hesitate to challenge them. The bad news is they could turn out to be a tougher nut to crack than you expected. Maybe you should just ignore them instead. |01-15-2015|leo
402|If someone tries to belittle your efforts over the next 24 hours it can only be because they are jealous of your ability to get things done. They are also jealous of your flamboyant style and the way (almost) everyone loves you.|01-16-2015|leo
403|If you find yourself at odds with someone you live or work with this weekend don’t make a big deal of it. Chances are it’s just a trivial difference and can easily be smoothed over. Neither of you really wants a fight. |01-17-2015|leo
404|There is no point trying to keep secrets from loved ones, not when they know half the story already. When the Sun moves into the partnership area of your chart on Tuesday you will have to come clean about what you’ve been up to.|01-18-2015|leo
405|It is quite likely that you will have a heated difference of opinion with someone today and you must not back down. Others will respect you more if you stand up for yourself, whether or not your opinion is factually correct. |01-19-2015|leo
406|There is no point trying to keep secrets from loved ones because they know you too well and can sense when you are trying to hide something. Come clean about what it is you have been up to. Chances are they won’t mind at all. |01-20-2015|leo
407|The planets urge you to keep a low profile today because if you call attention to yourself in your usual Leo way someone may decide to make a target of you. Let others speak up and take the flak for a change.|01-21-2015|leo
408|No matter how much you might like your heart to rule your head today you must not let it. Where money matters are concerned you must push personal feelings to one side and do what’s best for your long-term interests.|01-22-2015|leo
409|There is a ruthlessness about you at the moment, especially in partnership matters where you have no intention of letting anyone, not even those you love, take advantage of your feelings. Try not to be too hard-hearted though.|01-23-2015|leo
410|It does not matter how much the odds are against you over the next 48 hours you will come out ahead of the game. Anyone who doubts that Leo is the most competitive sign of the zodiac won’t doubt it much longer! |01-24-2015|leo
411|You will gain a lot of respect among the people who matter this week if you put personal feelings to one side and act for the good of the group. Chances are you will also gain financially towards the end of the week. |01-25-2015|leo
412|Try not to dwell on negative news as the week begins, especially if it involves someone you care for. According to the planets you are taking the situation far too seriously, certainly more seriously than anyone else is taking it. |01-26-2015|leo
413|You will get the chance to improve your position today but because your good fortune comes at someone else’s expense you may hesitate to take advantage of it. That’s very noble of you but not very smart. There are always winners and losers.|01-27-2015|leo
414|Don’t leave friends and family members guessing about what it is you expect of them. This is one of those times when you must spell things out in words of three syllables or less. It may make them look stupid but you cannot afford misunderstandings. |01-28-2015|leo
415|You will either draw closer to someone today or you will drift so far apart that you are unlikely ever to get back together again. Partnerships of all kinds are going through changes. In the long-term they will be changes for the better. |01-29-2015|leo
416|Keep your problems in perspective over the next 24 hours. You may wish that life was easier but in the greater scheme of things your “problems” are hardly worth worrying about – in fact they are opportunities for you to grow. |01-30-2015|leo
417|If you push yourself hard over the next 48 hours and you will create a momentum that carries you through the coming week. As a Leo you possess so much courage and so much confidence, so set your sights high. Then go even higher.|01-31-2015|leo
418|You may not find it easy to tell certain people how much they mean to you but you must make the effort over the next seven days. Leave loved ones and relatives in no doubt how you feel. They think you’re the bee’s knees too! |02-01-2015|leo
419|Stop dreaming about what you would like to do and actually start doing it. It does not matter how far-fetched your dream may be, if you start working towards it now it will, one day, come true – maybe a lot sooner than you think. |02-02-2015|leo
420|Because today’s full moon takes place in your sign you will be more emotional than usual, which has both advantages and disadvantages. Try not to let minor setbacks expand into what appear to be major traumas. They’re not.  |02-03-2015|leo
421|The pressure will be on today but that’s okay because no one handles it better than you. When the going gets tough the tough get going and one way or another you will go far over the next few days.|02-04-2015|leo
422|You don’t care what others think about your behavior. It may be true that you have gone over the top and offended someone important but so what? If you go through life watching your every word you won’t get much said. |02-05-2015|leo
423|Be careful how you talk to and deal with loved ones and family members today. You may not mean to give offence but something you say or do could be taken the wrong way and cause all sorts of problems.|02-06-2015|leo
424|If you have romantic feelings for someone then let them know this weekend. The planets suggest they are as infatuated with you as you are with them but, like you, they fear rejection. Let them know you think they’re great.|02-07-2015|leo
425|It does not matter if you have traded harsh words with certain people over the past few weeks because soon you will get the chance to set things right. Chances are they did not take what you said seriously anyway. |02-08-2015|leo
426|If you find you cannot handle a task on your own today don’t be shy about getting assistance. Friends and family will rally round if you ask them to but if you insist on struggling on alone they won’t lift a finger to help you. |02-09-2015|leo
427|Make a conscious effort to focus only on the facts today. The so-called experts will tell you this and tell you that but you should take it all with a large pinch of salt, especially when it’s your money they are talking about. |02-10-2015|leo
428|You will hear something to your advantage over the next 24 hours but it may take a while until you really “get it”. Don’t be reluctant to believe it just because the source of the information has not always been reliable in the past.|02-11-2015|leo
429|You will demand to be the center of attention today and if those you live and work with know what is good for them they will hand you the microphone, help you up on to the stage and let you get on with it. You’re a star! |02-12-2015|leo
430|It might be tempting to stick your nose in someone else’s business today but if you do you will most likely regret it, especially if the people in whose lives you are interfering know something about you that could be embarrassing.|02-13-2015|leo
431|You may feel out of your depth today but even if you are you won’t come to any harm, so quit worrying. The fact that, for once, the eyes of the world are not on you will give you freedom to come and go as you please.|02-14-2015|leo
432|What you thought was important just a few days ago won’t seem so important after the Sun changes signs on Wednesday. Partnership issues and affairs of the heart will fade in significance as you focus more on business and money matters. |02-15-2015|leo
433|Don’t waste time worrying about the ethics of what you are planning to do – just get on and do it and let the chips fall where they will. Actions always speak louder than words, so act fast and make sure the job gets done. |02-16-2015|leo
434|It’s likely you will worry a bit about money issues over the next few days, but that’s okay. Even if you are a bit short cash-wise at the moment the planets indicate you will make good your losses over the next few weeks. |02-17-2015|leo
435|If your sixth sense tells you that someone is not to be trusted you must not ignore it. Others may say you are jumping at shadows but deep down you can sense that something isn’t quite right, so err on the side of caution.|02-18-2015|leo
436|It may be that what a friend or family member has to tell you has some value in it, but what does your inner voice say? For some reason you are reluctant to trust your instincts at the moment but, ultimately, you can’t trust anything else. |02-19-2015|leo
437|You are in a helpful mood at the moment, which is nice, but don’t be too helpful for your own good. Do you really want to end up doing so much for other people that you have no time to do anything for yourself? Of course not.|02-20-2015|leo
438|If you get the urge to try something different this weekend, something you would not usually spend time or energy on, then just do it. Some people may say you are losing your mind but what do they know? They certainly don’t know you very well. |02-21-2015|leo
439|Try not to be too possessive about what you own and earn this week because that could lead to conflict with someone who thinks you should share more. Maybe they are right, maybe you have grown too attached to physical things of late. |02-22-2015|leo
440|Keep your standards high over the coming week and make sure those around you aim high as well. You will be judged as much on who you know as what you do, so make sure friends and colleagues are pulling their weight. |02-23-2015|leo
441|Spell out what it is you intend to do over the next few days so there can be no confusion. However, having made your plans public you must stick with them. If you change your mind without warning you deserve all the criticism you will get.|02-24-2015|leo
442|A friend or family member will bend over backwards to help you today and if you are smart you will let them, even though you don’t want to be in their debt. If you need some kind of financial assistance now is the time to ask.|02-25-2015|leo
443|Partners and colleagues won’t be happy if you go back on what you told them just a few days ago. Yes, your priorities have changed since then but if you made promises you must keep them. Then you can move on with a clear conscience. |02-26-2015|leo
444|Someone will appeal to your sense of duty today but you must not blindly do as they ask. You are more than willing to help but you must be convinced that what you are doing is for the greater good, not just to support their ego.|02-27-2015|leo
445|Don’t stay in one place doing just the one thing this weekend – get out and about, see new places and make new contacts. Some people may not be happy that you come and go as you please but so what? They can’t stop you.|02-28-2015|leo
446|Anyone who says you are too conservative by nature won’t be saying it much longer. This is going to be one of those weeks when, if you do something shocking, it will make you feel good – and do your reputation good too. |03-01-2015|leo
447|Your opinion about someone you work or do business with will change dramatically today and you will have to admit that you got them all wrong. Talk to them and get to know them better – it could be the start of a beautiful friendship. |03-02-2015|leo
448|You will go your own way and do your own thing today, and the more others try to persuade you to be more cautious the more risks you are likely to take. And why not? The planets suggest you can’t put a foot wrong.|03-03-2015|leo
449|Can you adapt? Can you change your opinions if you have to? It may not come easy to you but it’s a must today as Uranus, planet of changes, is so strong in your chart. All changes will be good for you, so embrace them.|03-04-2015|leo
450|Today’s full moon suggests you may have to cut back financially, most likely because you have bitten off more than you can chew or have aimed too high too soon. But there is no need to get angry with yourself: even a Leo makes mistakes.|03-05-2015|leo
451|Changes on the work front will move in your favor over the next few days, so be ready to take advantage of new opportunities and don’t feel too sorry for colleagues who fall out of favor. Would they feel sorry for you if the roles were reversed?|03-06-2015|leo
452|You will be in a generous mood this weekend and anyone who asks you to do them a favor is likely to find it granted. Just be careful that someone who does not share your natural honesty does not try to take advantage of you.|03-07-2015|leo
453|Begin something over the next few days that exercises your mind and broadens your horizons. If there is a particular subject you are interested in now is the time to look at it in a little more depth, maybe even study it professionally.|03-08-2015|leo
454|Make an effort to talk over your problems, especially your money problems, with someone who can not only lend a sympathetic ear but can help you with practical advice. You know very well who that someone is – so approach them. |03-09-2015|leo
455|Set yourself a difficult challenge and go all out to make a success of it. Jupiter in your sign, although moving retrograde, makes this the kind of day when limits do not exist, at least not for you. Aim high, then amaze everyone and go higher still.|03-10-2015|leo
456|Someone who is as different to you as chalk is to cheese will make a big impression on you today, big enough perhaps to change your assumptions about certain kinds of people. It’s simply not true that as a Leo you never change your mind.|03-11-2015|leo
457|There may be nothing wrong with your plans but that does not mean they are guaranteed to succeed. Saturn, the great taskmaster of the zodiac, is urging you to be more realistic about your aims and more modest about your abilities.|03-12-2015|leo
458|Flattery will get you everywhere today – you know the right thing to say to influence people in positions of power. You also know the right thing to say to ignite passion in the one you love. But will you have time for both?|03-13-2015|leo
459|The planets indicate it is time to admit defeat and give up on something that is clearly not going to work. Push your ego to one side and don’t think it reflects badly on you that you made a poor decision. Even Leos get it wrong occasionally. |03-14-2015|leo
460|What you get is what you deserve and if you did not get what you desired in recent weeks then, obviously, you did not deserve it. That might sound a little harsh but you need to be ruthlessly realistic if you are to do better in the future.|03-15-2015|leo
461|Something will happen today that is both a challenge and an opportunity. What you need to understand is that while the challenge may come from the outside it is the way you react to it on the inside that makes it an opportunity. |03-16-2015|leo
462|Do something dynamic over the next 24 hours, something that helps work off all that excess energy that has built up in recent weeks. This is also a good time to take a vacation – so long as it’s the kind where you are constantly active.|03-17-2015|leo
463|Someone will annoy you today by saying something that simply isn’t true. According to the planets they are trying to get you to overreact so they can use your words and actions against you, but you are not that gullible – are you?|03-18-2015|leo
464|You like to shock and the planets suggest you will do something outrageous over the next 24 hours. If it’s a joke you will need to make sure that everyone can see it’s a joke. And if it’s not a joke – why are you laughing so hard?|03-19-2015|leo
465|Something you thought of as a problem before won’t be seen as a problem any more, not because you have resolved it but because you refuse to take it seriously. Your attitude will soften and your perspective will change over the next 24 hours. |03-20-2015|leo
466|You are looking for ways to escape circumstances you feel are holding you back. Be aware, however, that some of these circumstances are not only holding you back but holding you up as well. Watch out you don’t fall on your face! |03-21-2015|leo
467|Keep what you have to say simple and to the point because the more complex it gets the less likely it is you will be understood. Unless, of course, your aim is to purposely confuse people, in which case by all means let it get complicated. |03-22-2015|leo
468|Put yourself out for other people. Go above and beyond the call of duty. Let the world see you are willing to make sacrifices. Your efforts will be rewarded in the long-term and, more importantly, you will feel good about yourself right now. |03-23-2015|leo
469|Something will happen today that makes you realize how much more is possible and how far short of your potential you have been falling. You will get new opportunities to make more of your talents, but the effort must come from you.|03-24-2015|leo
470|You will solve a riddle that has been bugging you for ages – and will kick yourself when you realize just how simple the answer is. Chances are you will experience many such moments over the next few days. Don’t kick yourself too often. |03-25-2015|leo
471|You are going to be thinking a lot about your work and your reputation over the next few days. But don’t make any big decisions concerning your career just yet because even better options will reveal themselves early next week.|03-26-2015|leo
472|Don’t take on extra tasks over the next 24 hours. With the commitments you already have you are likely to be on the go from first thing in the morning to last thing at night and if you add to your workload you are asking for trouble.|03-27-2015|leo
473|Tone down your act a bit over the next 48 hours, especially if you are the kind of Leo who thinks life is one big party. Others have serious issues to deal with and are unlikely to appreciate your efforts to get them singing and dancing.|03-28-2015|leo
474|You won’t have to make much of an effort this week because this is one of those times when things will get done one way or the other anyway. Sit back and don’t worry if you fall behind in your schedule – you’ll catch up later. |03-29-2015|leo
475|No one has the right to tell you what to believe or what to do and anyone who tries will feel the rough edge of your tongue. Is that an over-reaction? Maybe, but better you go too far than let them think you are an easy touch. |03-30-2015|leo
476|You may be tempted to show the world how strong you can be today but your tough guy routine will have more of an effect if you wait until Thursday when luck planet Jupiter is in your favor. Until then, keep a low profile. |03-31-2015|leo
477|You are determined to move up in the world and if you start making things happen now it won’t be long before you are in a position of prominence. Once you get a taste for power you won’t want to go back to where you were before.|04-01-2015|leo
478|You don’t need to justify what you believe or what you are doing to anyone. Fortunately, with your ruler the Sun linked to Jupiter in your sign today no one will question you with any great enthusiasm. They simply won’t dare!|04-02-2015|leo
479|What you do for others today you will also in some way do for yourself. Friendships and partnerships will not only bring personal satisfaction but at some stage in the future will pay off financially too. Good news for a change.|04-03-2015|leo
480|Anyone who thinks you don’t know how to laugh at life will have to think again over the next 48 hours. The only danger is you might laugh at things which some people take seriously, but don’t let that stop you – it’s their problem, not yours.|04-04-2015|leo
481|Your confidence is returning and in a matter of days those feelings of dread and doubt will completely disappear. The fact is, of course, you had nothing to dread in the first place but somehow you managed to persuade yourself you did. |04-05-2015|leo
482|With the Sun and Uranus very much on your side there is nothing you cannot do and nothing you cannot possess. But try not to be too domineering or you could make an enemy of someone it would be more sensible to have as a friend. |04-06-2015|leo
483|Don’t be surprised if something you feel strongly about fails to get much of a response from those you feel should be most concerned. Maybe you are too close to the situation. And maybe it’s not as bad as you think.|04-07-2015|leo
484|Some problems go away if you take no notice of them but the problem you are wrestling with at the moment needs to be dealt with immediately. Yes, you can try to ignore it but there is no way it is going to ignore you.|04-08-2015|leo
485|If you get the urge to try something different over the next 24 hours then by all means follow your instincts. Leo may be a “fixed” sign but you’re not as set in your ways as some people think – in fact you can be quite adventurous.|04-09-2015|leo
486|You will discover something about a friend or work colleague today that answers a lot of questions. What you discover might be amusing but you are advised to keep it to yourself. They won’t be happy if you broadcast it to the world.|04-10-2015|leo
487|You are in one of your party moods at the moment and there will be plenty of dancing and singing this weekend. Don’t listen to those who say you should be more serious about life – they are exactly the kind of people you don’t want to know.|04-11-2015|leo
488|You can and you will be the center of attention over the next few days. The more others try to keep the spotlight pointing at themselves the more creative you will be in finding ways to get yourself in the picture. You’re a star.|04-12-2015|leo
489|A week from now the Sun moves into the career area of your chart, so start making plans about how you want things to develop on the work front. Start thinking too of how you can get well-connected people to help you |04-13-2015|leo
490|There is so much you want to do and so much you can do but don’t do it all in one go. You may feel that if you don’t act immediately the opportunity will be lost but that’s not true. You have all the time in the world.|04-14-2015|leo
491|Listen carefully to what friends and colleagues tell you today – and, if what they tell you makes sense, act on it immediately. And don’t be so suspicious. Not everyone is looking to make money at your expense. Some people are honest.|04-15-2015|leo
492|Push any problems you have on the work front to one side and promise yourself that you will deal with them next week. The Sun’s change of signs on Monday will sweep them all away and you won’t actually have to do anything yourself. |04-17-2015|leo
493|You will have a much clearer idea of what is and is not possible thanks to today’s new moon in your fellow Fire sign of Aries. If you expect the best the best will happen, so stop being negative and believe in yourself.|04-18-2015|leo
494|You have never lacked for self-belief but over the next few days you could get a bit reckless, both at home and at work, with disastrous results. You may think you have something to prove but you have proved yourself enough times already. |04-19-2015|leo
495|Someone who is usually the life and soul of the party is a bit depressed at the moment and you must make it your business to find out what is wrong. Calm their fears and cheer them up. You know just how to make them smile again.|04-20-2015|leo
496|Tell everyone what they want to hear today, even if you don’t believe a word of it and even if you don’t believe they believe it either. You are not in the mood for arguments, so say the right things and enjoy a peaceful 24 hours.|04-21-2015|leo
497|People expect you to be bold and brash, so don’t let them down. But don’t be too enamored of your own brilliance or you may put them off. If you want to impress important people you need to get the right balance between ambition and humility.|04-22-2015|leo
498|Anyone who thinks they can take advantage of your trusting nature will soon learn that you are not so easily deceived. Trusting you may be but stupid you most certainly are not, as they will find out to their cost today.|04-23-2015|leo
499|Something will happen today that catches you off guard and you will wonder how you could have missed signs that, with hindsight, were so glaringly obvious. Whatever the reason, don’t lose any sleep over it – it’s really not that important. |04-24-2015|leo
500|You won’t hesitate to speak your mind over the next 48 hours but that does not mean you should let the world know everything you are thinking. Stick to the point you are trying to make and keep everything else strictly private. |04-25-2015|leo
501|Moderation is a must, especially if you are the kind of Leo who likes to get in a fight. Even if you are in the right and the facts are on your side it won’t do you any good if your opponent is bigger and better connected than you. |04-26-2015|leo
502|Be careful what you say as the new week gets under way because the planets warn you could say far too much. You may have been able to laugh off your big mouth in the past but now others won’t be quite so forgiving.|04-27-2015|leo
503|Tackle tasks and objectives you might not have the confidence or courage to tackle at other times. Yes, powerful people are likely to oppose you but you are pretty powerful too in your own way. Let them worry about you.|04-28-2015|leo
504|If your everyday routine has become a bit too predictable now is the time to do something about it. There will be some serious upheavals in the working pattern of your life over the next few days. Take full advantage of them.|04-29-2015|leo
505|For too long now you have been worrying about your career, your reputation and your place in the world and neglecting the things that bring you happiness, such as friends and family and travel. It’s time to restore a more sensible balance.|04-30-2015|leo
506|Social activities are under excellent stars at the moment, so take time out of your busy schedule to have fun with friends. Also, if there is some kind of cause or social movement that is close to your heart now is the time to get more involved.|05-01-2015|leo
507|Can one good person make a difference? Yes they can, and you will get the chance to prove it over the next 48 hours. Stand up for what you believe in and don’t worry about rivals and enemies. You have right on your side. |05-02-2015|leo
508|Wherever you go and whatever you do over the coming week the results will not be what you expected. Which is not to say they won’t be good but there will be times when you wonder how you get yourself into these sorts of scrapes. |05-03-2015|leo
509|Some may say you are being unduly cautious, and maybe you are, but today’s full moon warns this is not a good time to take chances. You know the old saying: “If it’s not broke, don’t fix it.” Things are okay as they are. |05-04-2015|leo
510|Someone is sure to be offended by what you say or do today but you won’t care one little bit. With Jupiter in your sign you feel you can do as you please, and to an extent you are right, but there may still be long-term consequences.|05-05-2015|leo
511|What others are suggesting may sound enticing but before you go along with their plans try to work out what’s in it for you and what’s in it for them. Chances are you could negotiate yourself a much better deal. |05-06-2015|leo
512|Do you think with your head or do you feel with your heart? Hopefully you try to do both but over the next two or three days you should favor your heart over your head. Not everything in life needs to make sense.|05-07-2015|leo
513|What you want to do and what you have to do are likely to be two entirely different things today. But don’t let that depress you because you can still enjoy yourself. No one is more creative at finding ways to have fun.|05-08-2015|leo
514|Someone you work or do business with will insist that certain things are done in certain ways this weekend. Don’t try to dissuade them. Most likely they will mess it all up and in doing so make you look good.|05-09-2015|leo
515|You have been trying too hard to win friends and influence people and when you try too hard at anything it tends to have the opposite effect to what you desire. However, don’t take that to mean you should not try at all. |05-11-2015|leo
516|Someone will say something that hurts your feelings today but don’t take it to heart. Chances are they are motivated by nothing more than jealousy. What are they jealous of? Your popularity, your creativity, your energy – just about everything really.|05-12-2015|leo
517|Creative activities will go well over the next 24 hours and they will go even better if you don’t try to do everything yourself. Get friends and relatives to assist you with the bits you find difficult or boring – they will happily help you out.|05-13-2015|leo
518|Something will happen over the next few days that seems like a setback, but later in the month it will become clear it was exactly the opposite, so stop worrying so much what might happen in the future. Focus on the here and now.|05-14-2015|leo
519|Anything is possible if you want it enough and according to the planets there is one thing you want above all else at the moment. Jupiter in your sign endows you with huge self-belief, so success is all but guaranteed.|05-15-2015|leo
520|The planets warn you will meet someone who tries to dampen your spirits over the next couple of days. They will only succeed if you let them – so don’t let them. Keep smiling and let the world see your sunny disposition remains unbroken.|05-16-2015|leo
521|If you believe you are worth more than you are currently being paid then now is the time to press your claim. Important people will look kindly on you during the early part of the week, so speak up and make sure you get heard. |05-17-2015|leo
522|You will be putting yourself about over the next two or three days, especially on the work front where you can sense that the present confusion and chaos will give rise to new opportunities. Change is always good, for you at least. |05-18-2015|leo
523|You seem to believe that there is no longer any danger, that your critics and rivals have all been dealt with and no longer pose a threat. Maybe you’re right, but can you be sure? The planets warn you still need to be on your guard.|05-19-2015|leo
524|You are going to have to get along with all sorts of people over the next few days and the sooner you recognize that fact the better. You may be highly individualistic but you can work with others if you try. So try!|05-20-2015|leo
525|You will see results today, tomorrow and over the weekend for something you started earlier in the year and that’s good because you were thinking of giving up. Stick it out. Show some staying power. The tide is about to turn.|05-21-2015|leo
526|The most important thing today and over the weekend is that you make sure that those you help are those who most deserve your help. It’s a sad fact of life that some people are happy to live on others’ efforts rather than their own. |05-22-2015|leo
527|You can quite easily ridicule someone’s opinions and make them look silly but is that such a good idea? The planets warn if you make them look bad they will hold a grudge against you for years to come. It’s not worth it. |05-23-2015|leo
528|It may be true that certain people have not been pulling their weight but don’t make an issue of it until later in the week. If you accuse them too early they will make a big fuss about it and make it seem as if it’s your fault.|05-24-2015|leo
529|There is an art to relaxation and it is an art you will need to master over the next few days. There may be a dozen things you would like to be doing now but there is only one thing you must do – be kind to yourself.|05-25-2015|leo
