1|You may have strong opinions about something and you have every right to express them but you need to accept that not everyone agrees with you. Try not to get angry if others refuse to see things your way. It’s no big deal.|12-02-2013|pisces
2|You may be dreading upheavals on the work front but the planets suggest you have little to worry about. Yes, in the short-term there will be some adjustments to make, but over time you will benefit from a change or regime.|12-03-2013|pisces
3|Someone who has a lot more experience than you could be of enormous help    today, but you need to remember that they can’t ready your mind. Whatever it is you desire you must spell it out for them in plain and simple language.|12-04-2013|pisces
4|Someone in a position of authority will praise you for a job well done and your confidence will go through the roof. But don’t get sloppy. The reason you did such a good job was because you planned carefully and worked hard. Keep at it. |12-05-2013|pisces
5|You need more fun in your life but you won’t get it hanging around the same old places doing the same old things with the same old people. The planets are urging you to be more adventurous. Life is a gamble or it is nothing.|12-06-2013|pisces
6|Seek out people who share your values and beliefs. Not only can you change the world if you work intelligently together but you can also benefit in material ways. It’s okay to be a Good Samaritan and make a profit too.|12-07-2013|pisces
7|If your reputation means anything to you then you must be careful what you say over the next few days. If you blurt out an opinion that does not sit well with the powers that be you could do your career prospects considerable harm.|12-08-2013|pisces
8|You are entitled to your opinions but if you are smart you will tone down some of your more outrageous ideas today, at least while in the presence of people you need to stay on good terms with. Certain things don’t have to be said.|12-09-2013|pisces
9|If you are thinking of making a trip of some kind, that’s good, but keep your plans flexible. Last minute changes are more likely than not over the next 24 hours, so be prepared and, more importantly, be open to new possibilities.|12-10-2013|pisces
10|Be decisive today: think and act fast and don’t worry too much about what the consequences might be. Your forthright manner may annoy a few people but that’s okay. They need to know you’re not the sort to be messed around.|12-11-2013|pisces
11|Are you making the most of your time? Chances are you have allowed hours, days, even weeks to slip by without doing anything special. That must now change. Get serious about your ambitions and do something out of the ordinary today.|12-12-2013|pisces
12|Jupiter and Saturn link across the most favorable angles of your chart today and the most likely outcome is that you will be rewarded for services you have done for others in the past. Enjoy your good fortune – no one deserves it more.|12-13-2013|pisces
13|You will need to read between the lines this weekend because almost certainly the real story will be nothing like the one other people are trying to sell you. Facts are important but don’t forget they can conceal as well as enlighten.|12-14-2013|pisces
14|There may be a certain amount of strife over the next few days as partners and loved ones get emotional about things that don’t worry you in the slightest. Do what you can to soothe them but don’t let their negativity spoil your plans.|12-15-2013|pisces
15|You must check facts and figures carefully today as Mercury linked to retrograde Jupiter warns that either someone is trying to deceive you or you will in some way deceive yourself. See what is there, not what you hope is there.|12-16-2013|pisces
16|Accidents will happen but that does not mean they have to happen to you. The planets warn that if you go looking for adventure you will find it okay- which may be fun to begin with but later on it will be you who slips and falls.|12-17-2013|pisces
17|You seem to have lost your way a little and the planets suggest you swallow your pride and ask someone who knows what they are doing to help you. Don’t think of it as a sign of failure if anything it’s a sign of maturity.|12-18-2013|pisces
18|You need to convince those in positions of power that you deserve to be given more responsibility and the rewards that go with it. Timing is everything and the right time is now – so get a move on and move up in the world.|12-19-2013|pisces
19|By all means state your case today but don’t get upset if others disagree with you and try to pick holes in your arguments. The world is a big enough place for all shades of opinion, so agree to disagree and leave it at that.|12-20-2013|pisces
20|You need to take a more relaxed view of partnerships and friendships, both in your personal life and at work. Treat others as if they are allies and equals rather than rivals and enemies and life will be fun and profitable in equal measure.|12-21-2013|pisces
21|Your willingness to work as part of a team will bring many benefits over the next few weeks, not least the boost it gives to your reputation. Friends will be lucky for you but employers and other authority figures will be luckier still.|12-22-2013|pisces
22|What appears to be a disappointment today will have you jumping for joy later in the week, so don’t let your emotions swing too wildly one way or the other. Overall your outlook is extremely good, so don’t waste time worrying.|12-23-2013|pisces
23|Try not to get too emotionally involved in other people’s problems. Life is full of ups and downs and you, and they, would be wise to accept that fact. A more light-hearted approach from you today will be an example for them to follow.|12-24-2013|pisces
24|This should be a fun time for you but there is one unpleasant fact that has to be faced. The good news is that once you resolve to deal with the issue it won’t be anywhere near as bad as you fear, so be bold and take action now.|12-25-2013|pisces
25|Pay attention to what friends and family members tell you over the next 24 hours because they can see something that you have missed. If you listen to what they say and act on their advice it could save you a lot of trouble.|12-26-2013|pisces
26|Steer clear of subjects and situations which lead to disagreements over the next 24 hours. If you think that your opinions might be too controversial and that some individuals or groups might be offended, keep them to yourself – for now.|12-27-2013|pisces
27|Sit back and take what comes your way this weekend. Almost certainly it will be pleasant and almost certainly it will be profitable. You don’t have to do anything special – just be yourself and the let the universe reward you for it.|12-28-2013|pisces
28|Everyone is entitled to their opinions but that does not mean all opinions are equal. If a point of view you have held for years is shown to be lacking in some way then don’t be afraid to give up on it. Opinions evolve like everything else.|12-29-2013|pisces
29|Your dreams can and will come true – if you believe in them. Make sure you share them with friends and loved ones too because your dreams and their dreams overlap in so many ways. Work together toward a long-term goal.|12-30-2013|pisces
30|Stick to your principles over the next 24 hours, even if you lose out financially. Others can be underhanded and devious if they so wish, but you are made of better stuff. It’s not about money, it’s about doing the right thing. |12-31-2013|pisces
31|You will be surprised how quickly and easily you get things done, so stop telling yourself that you are too far behind to catch up, because you’re not. Get the boring stuff out of the way early, then have fun for the rest of the day.|01-01-2014|pisces
32|Everyone you know may believe one thing but if your instincts tell you a different story it is your instincts youmust trust. There is such a thing as herd mentality and there’s a lot of it about at the moment. Always think for yourself.|01-02-2014|pisces
33|Whatever your special talent happens to be, you must put it to good use. If an opportunity arises in your work or career grab it with both hands and don’t worry that you may not be up to the task. You’ll ace it and make a name for yourself. |01-03-2014|pisces
34|You are under no obligation to get involved in other people’s problems — in fact you are strongly advised to steer clear of them all this weekend. Yes, of course, you want to help, but some things are best left to run their natural course.|01-04-2014|pisces
35|Make it your aim this week to form alliances with people who share your concerns. You don’t have to agree on every single detail about every single issue, just the overall picture. Together you can create something important.|01-05-2014|pisces
36|An important arrangement may have to be changed at the last moment today but don’t get angry or uptight because most likely it will work in your favor. Strange as it may seem your friends really do know what is best for you.|01-06-2014|pisces
37|There is a great deal going on behind the scenes at the moment, so don’t make too many plans because they are sure to change. If someone asks you to take on more work, turn them down flat — it’s the last thing you need right now. |01-07-2014|pisces
38|You must let a certain person know that you have no intention of allowing them to get rich at your expense. Today’s Mars-Jupiter link will bring tensions to a head, making it the perfect time to say what’s on your mind – loudly!|01-08-2014|pisces
39|If someone wants to rant and rave and make a nuisance of themselves let them get on with it. Most likely they are hoping you will overreact. Don’t give them the satisfaction. Treat them with the contempt they deserve – ignore them completely.|01-09-2014|pisces
40|It may seem to other people that you are lucky, that what you have got you have not really earned, but it isn’t true. The cosmos always rewards those who deserve it and no one deserves it more than you. Why? Because you’re so nice.|01-10-2014|pisces
41||01-11-2014|pisces
42|Be careful what information you choose to trust this week, even if it comes from a reliable source. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to romantic matters. It could be that someone is deliberately stirring up trouble.|01-12-2014|pisces
43|You will leave what you have to do to the very last minute today – and because you have to act fast and without thinking will most likely make a good job of it. There’s a lot to be said for living on the edge – but not all the time.|01-13-2014|pisces
44|Try not to come on too strong today or you may scare away the people you most need to connect with. Remember too that not everyone wants to change the world – in fact some people like it just the way it is. Respect that fact.|01-14-2014|pisces
45|It will pay you to steer clear of touchy subjects over the next 48 hours. Yes, of course, there are things going on in the world that you disapprove of but will getting involved on an emotional level change anything? Of course not.|01-15-2014|pisces
46|You may find it hard to stay focused today and if that is the case you are advised to stop trying and let the cosmic winds blow you where they will. Ultimately all roads lead to where you are destined to be, so why struggle?|01-16-2014|pisces
47|Sometimes things go wrong for a reason and sometimes things go wrong for no reason at all. What goes wrong today will most likely fall in the latter category but it’s really no big deal. Come Monday you will have forgotten all about it.|01-17-2014|pisces
48|It may feel as if a stage or cycle in your life is coming to an end, and maybe it is, but there is no reason why you should feel sad about it. By all means spend some time thinking about what it all means, but have fun too.|01-18-2014|pisces
49|You will be happier working behind the scenes over the next few days. In fact, as the Sun moves into the most sensitive area of your chart on Monday you will avoid the limelight at all costs. Being noticed does not appeal to you at all.|01-19-2014|pisces
50|What happens over the next few days, and especially towards the end of the week, will toughen you up and make you less likely to crack under pressure in the future. On this occasion, short-term difficulties will lead to long-term gains.|01-20-2014|pisces
51|This may be a difficult time for you and you are certainly more sensitive than usual, but it is also a time when you can learn a great deal about yourself, which in turn makes success in the long-term more likely. Self-knowledge is the key.|01-21-2014|pisces
52|Don’t worry if the party spirit seems to have passed you by because it is the inner spirit, the real you, that matters. The planets indicate that the deeper you think about your life and its meaning today the more you will enjoy it tomorrow.|01-22-2014|pisces
53|Be careful who you confide in today because if you reveal your secrets to the wrong person they won’t remain secret for long! Even with friends you can trust it might be wise not to let them in on potentially embarrassing information.|01-23-2014|pisces
54|You need to rediscover your passion for a project that started off well but then tailed away as other things demanded your time and attention. It doesn’t have to be a fantasy that remains forever unfulfilled. There is still time to make a success of it.|01-24-2014|pisces
55|Take care that your emotions don’t sweep you away over the next 48 hours. That applies not only to affairs of the heart but also to situations where you feel sorry for someone who is not as fortunate as you. It’s not your fault.|01-25-2014|pisces
56|A lot may be going on in the world at the moment but the only thing that should matter to you is what is going on inside your head. Think deeply about your life and the direction it seems to be taking. Then make a decision. Then act.|01-26-2014|pisces
57|A quick decision is not always the best decision, so stop worrying that you are being left behind and need to do some catching up. According to the planets you are precisely where you are supposed to be and don’t need to change a thing.|01-27-2014|pisces
58|This is one of the most important times of the year for you, especially if you are fed-up with who you are and what you are doing and wish to transform your existence. So, who do you want to be and where do you want to be it?|01-28-2014|pisces
59|Listen to advice, and don’t be afraid to act on what you hear. Not everyone is trying to trick you or steal from you, so play down your suspicions and play up to the kind of important people who can help you. They’re on your side.|01-29-2014|pisces
60|Why do you have so many doubts? And why do you let those doubts hold you back? You’ve got to be more ambitious. You’ve got to be more adventurous. This could be the day when your life changes for the better – but only you can make it happen.|01-30-2014|pisces
61|Your future has rarely looked brighter. So why so glum? Whatever the reason you need to snap out of it and recognize that, compared to most people, you are on easy street. All you really have to worry about is staying there.|01-31-2014|pisces
62|Whatever has been worrying you in recent weeks will fade to nothing this weekend, leaving you feeling as if anything is possible again. But be careful. Don’t go to extremes and take on a task that is clearly too much for you.|02-01-2014|pisces
63|Make sure you are aware of what is going on around you today. Most importantly of all make sure you can see how other people’s decisions might affect your own aims and ambitions. On the work front especially, take nothing for granted.|02-03-2014|pisces
64|You are so supremely self-confident at the moment that you can’t see the huge obstacle that is just a little way ahead of you on the path you have taken. You will see it in a day or two but, in the meantime, ignorance is bliss!|02-04-2014|pisces
65|Whatever you start today will most likely be a success, maybe even a huge success, but as from tomorrow you won’t be quite so lucky, so if there is something that simply has to be done, you are advised to get on with it — now. |02-05-2014|pisces
66|You are hardly the most decisive person at the best of times and with Mercury, planet of communication and the mind, turning retrograde in your sign today you will change your mind yet again. Others won’t like it but you are who you are.|02-06-2014|pisces
67|What society tells you is important and what your inner voice tells you is important are likely to be two entirely different things. It does not matter how well qualified some people may be, you should never go against your instincts.|02-07-2014|pisces
68|You will be in a remarkably forgiving mood over the next few days, and that’s good because there’s a lot to forgive. The thing to remember is that you are not just forgiving for other people’s benefit but also for your own.|02-08-2014|pisces
69|You may be tempted to bend rules and cut corners but if you do you will be found out around the time of the full moon on the 14th. You don’t need to give yourself an unfair advantage – your luck will change for the better very soon.|02-10-2014|pisces
70|You may be tempted to act first and justify your actions later, but if you do, you will have a lot of explaining to do. Today’s Sun-Saturn link warns that the consequences of misguided action could be severe, so tread carefully. |02-11-2014|pisces
71|Stop selling yourself short and start making the kind of moves that will get you noticed. Even if you are the kind of Pisces who prefers to stay in the background you will have to give part of yourself over to the public domain.|02-12-2014|pisces
72|You may not be as ambitious as some people but you have no end of dreams you would like to see come true. One dream more than most has your attention now, but is it a realistic dream or is it a fantasy dream? You need to decide.|02-13-2014|pisces
73|What you have been doing is good but the way you have been doing it is bad and today’s full moon will in some way or other highlight that fact. It’s not too late to learn that the ends do not, as some fools claim, justify the means.|02-14-2014|pisces
74|Stop blaming yourself for events over which you have no control. Because you are such an emotional person you tend to dwell on situations where people get hurt, even if it isn’t your fault. Instead or worrying, try helping in practical ways.|02-15-2014|pisces
75|Your self-confidence may have taken a dive in recent weeks but when the Sun moves into your sign tomorrow you will get the lift you need and soon you will be soaring again. Think, feel and act positive in everything you do.|02-17-2014|pisces
76|The Sun moves into your sign today and even if your birthday is not for some weeks yet you should go out and celebrate. The next few weeks will be extra special, so start making plans and believe, really believe, that your dreams will come true.|02-18-2014|pisces
77|The Sun is moving through your sign and you’re feeling on top of the world, but today’s Mercury-Saturn link could dampen your mood a bit with some negative news. In the greater scheme of things, it’s of no real importance, so keep smiling. |02-19-2014|pisces
78|It may be true that the higher you climb the further you have to fall but don’t let that stop you aiming for the top of the mountain, or even the stars. Life is supposed to be an adventure, so put fear and doubt behind you and be who you were meant to be.|02-20-2014|pisces
79|Most things are going your way at the moment but Saturn, planet of restriction, is still holding you back from following your dream. Take it as a sign that you are not yet ready to make that dream a reality. It will happen when the time is right.|02-21-2014|pisces
80|The Sun joins forces with Neptune, your ruler, in your sign this weekend, which means that all your best Pisces qualities will come to the fore. You may not always be a saint but you have the potential to be one. Do good deeds for everyone.|02-22-2014|pisces
81|Don’t listen to the doubters and the cynics – if there is something you want to do then just do it, no matter how foolhardy it seems to the world at large. This is a time for taking risks and pushing limits. You may find there are no limits.|02-23-2014|pisces
82|This is very much your time of year – and a time to take risks. What happens around the time of the new moon on the 1st is sure to delight you but it will be so much better if you start making creative and romantic things happen now.|02-24-2014|pisces
83|Success is yours if you want it enough but that begs the question: DO you want it enough? Pisces is often a laidback sort of sign, so maybe you are happy taking each day as it comes. If so, that’s okay – you are who you are.|02-25-2014|pisces
84|You like to make bold decisions but with Jupiter and Uranus at odds today almost any decision you make is likely to have unforeseen consequences. With that fact in mind maybe you should just leave things alone for the next 24 hours.|02-26-2014|pisces
85|Be assertive and let partners and colleagues and even employers know that you intend to put your own needs first. This is your time of year and you have every right and every reason to be a little bit selfish. It’s in a good cause!|02-27-2014|pisces
86|Now that Mercury, planet of the mind, is ending its retrograde phase your self-belief will soar. And with both a new moon and a wonderful Sun-Jupiter link over the next 48 hours this really could be one of the weekends of the year. Enjoy!|02-28-2014|pisces
87|A new moon in your birth sign promises a new beginning, and with Jupiter on your side too there is no way you can be anything less than amazing this weekend. There are no limits to what you can dream and what you can do. So do it!|03-01-2014|pisces
88|Saturn, planet of limitation, will encourage you to think about your long-term plans. Are they realistic? Are they what you truly desire? Give it some thought and recognize that you don’t have to make a final decision any time soon. Take each day as it comes.|03-02-2014|pisces
89|Pluto, planet of power, will help you not just change your life but transform it over the next 12 months. What is it you dream of doing? Who is it you dream of being? There is no excuse for leaving things as they are. Change yourself and change the world.|03-03-2014|pisces
90|Your powers of persuasion will move to a higher level this year, enabling you to convince others that you know what you are talking about. Sooner or later, of course, your words will be put to the test, so don’t go making claims that may not be true.|03-04-2014|pisces
91|If someone is in trouble today you will ride to their rescue with no questions asked. However, while it’s good of you to be generous with your time you must be careful about how you use your money. And remember, it is YOUR money.|03-05-2014|pisces
92|You will get a fresh burst of energy today, enabling you to finish something you started a long time ago. Some people believe that Pisceans are lazy, that they don’t like to push themselves too hard. Time to prove them wrong.|03-06-2014|pisces
93|Someone you are fond of has made a silly mistake and is feeling bad about it. They know what they did wrong, so don’t labor the point. Instead, give them an uplifting pep-talk and tell them to get on with it. It’s what they do next that counts.|03-07-2014|pisces
94|Anyone who thinks you are too easygoing to get things done will be amazed by how dynamic you are over the next 48 hours. You won’t have time for or patience with those who drag their feet. The world turned upside-down!|03-08-2014|pisces
95|Some of the risks you took recently were aimless and without meaning. Now you need to balance things out by being more responsible. Does that sound boring? Don’t worry, it won’t be – in fact you’ll have more fun than you know what to do with!|03-09-2014|pisces
96|For best results over the coming 12 months plan well ahead and leave as few things as possible to chance. That might not sound like a recipe for fun but in a strange way you will enjoy being in control of your impulses. Maybe it’s because it’s all so unusual!|03-10-2014|pisces
97|Be careful what you agree to over the next 24 hours because the planets warn you don’t have all the facts. Don’t accept what other people tell you simply because they look good and sound honest – it’s most likely part of the act.|03-11-2014|pisces
98|Do something big and exciting with your life over the next 12 months. Time waits for no man and if you carry on drifting as you have been of late you may one day look back and regret not being more adventurous. What have you got to lose? Only your fear.|03-12-2014|pisces
99|The Sun in your sign is protecting you from harm and with Saturn on your side as well today it’s as if you have some kind of force field around keeping negative ideas, and negative people, at bay. Think only good things about the world.|03-13-2014|pisces
100|There are so many positive influences on your birthday this year that you can’t help but do something out of the ordinary over the next 12 months. It may or may not mean you make a million dollars but you will certainly make waves, and lots of new friends.|03-14-2014|pisces
101|Because tomorrow’s full moon occurs in your opposite sign partners and loved ones and work colleagues may be a bit touchy over the next few days. Make sure you don’t react in kind. The moment you do it means they have won.|03-15-2014|pisces
102|A full moon on your birthday means you will have to make the effort, each and every day, to keep your feelings on an even keel. For best results, take up meditation or some other activity that helps you keep your body, mind and emotions in harmony.|03-16-2014|pisces
103|Now is the time to be open about your opinions. Now is the time to be ruthlessly honest. If you have things to say you must let everyone know what is on your mind. If you don’t speak up now you’ll be sorry about it later on.|03-17-2014|pisces
104|Listen to your intuition and act on what it tells you. The more certain ideas insinuate their way into your mind the more likely it is they are pointing you in the direction that is uniquely right for you. You already know the answers, so listen to yourself.|03-18-2014|pisces
105|The planets indicate that good news concerning your money situation will be coming your way over the next few days. You won’t, of course, get something for nothing but you will at least have more cash in your pocket. Spend it wisely.|03-19-2014|pisces
106|This is a milestone birthday for you. You may or may not be at a significant age but the planets indicate that the next 12 months will be special, so special in fact that your life will change in ways that delight you. You’ll change too and very much for the better.|03-20-2014|pisces
107|A question that has been nagging at your brain for such a long time will finally be answered today. It may surprise you how simple the solution is but isn’t that often the way? Next time, try not to make such a big deal of it.|03-21-2014|pisces
108|What happens over the next few days will determine whether your dreams come true or whether they remain in the realms of wishful thinking. By all means plan long-term but act and react on a daily, hourly, even a minute-by-minute basis.|03-22-2014|pisces
109|Let your heart rule your head over the next few days. Mercury in your sign makes you want to rationalize your feelings but sometimes it’s better to trust what comes from within, even if you can’t explain it in any rational way. |03-23-2014|pisces
110|You will most likely make a number of small gains over the next few days – which are then cancelled out by a number of small losses. Overall you won’t be out of pocket, so take the rough with the smooth and enjoy the journey.|03-24-2014|pisces
111|It will pay you to be secretive about money matters today. According to the planets your rivals are on the lookout for opportunities to grow rich and if they can do so at your expense then so much the better. Stay sharp and don’t let it happen.|03-25-2014|pisces
112|This is the perfect day to make promises and resolutions. Mercury, planet of the mind, is totally on your side at the moment, so decide what it is you desire and commit to making it yours. The universe will hear your pledge and respond favorably.|03-26-2014|pisces
113|Something will happen today that makes you wonder if there is more going on behind the scenes than you suspected. Make it your business to find out why certain people are acting so strangely – and use what you discover for your own advantage.|03-27-2014|pisces
114|Even if you are the kind of Pisces who does not like to rock the boat you will let certain people know where they have been going wrong. But don’t just say the words – show them in practical ways how they can make things right again.|03-28-2014|pisces
115|There is no point getting worked up about your financial situation. The planets indicate that if you stay calm and think straight this weekend you can quite easily find a way out of the mess you are in. You may even end up making a profit.|03-29-2014|pisces
116|You must be even-handed when dealing with loved ones this week. If you give even the slightest impression that you favor one person over another you could cause all sorts of emotional upsets. If you’ve got a favorite, don’t let it show. |03-30-2014|pisces
117|A little cooperation will go a long way today, especially as so many people seem to be looking for excuses to start a fight. Victory does not always go to the bravest or the brightest – sometimes it goes to those who get themselves organized.|03-31-2014|pisces
118|You have some important personal issues to deal with, issues that won’t wait, so let your friends know they may be seeing less of you for a while. Get your emotional life in order first, then go out and have fun with your mates.|04-01-2014|pisces
119|If you made a promise of some kind you must keep it. If you try to wriggle out of it now you will damage your reputation, maybe not beyond repair but certainly to the extent that certain people won’t trust you so easily again.|04-02-2014|pisces
120|If you want something today there is every chance that someone will give it to you – but you have got to ask them directly. If you try dropping hints chances are they won’t understand, so spell it out for them in plain and simple language.|04-03-2014|pisces
121|You will find it easy to see the good in other people today – and they in turn will realize what a special friend they have in you. You can’t love the whole world, of course, but the world has a special place in its heart for you.|04-04-2014|pisces
122|You won’t find it hard to show your feelings this weekend. As Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your sign you will go out of your way to let others know how much you appreciate their efforts. Your love life is looking good too.|04-05-2014|pisces
123|Someone you think of as a rival will take a tumble this week and you are perfectly placed to benefit. Being the nice person you are you may feel a bit sorry for them but don’t let that stop you from cashing in. You deserve some success.|04-06-2014|pisces
124|Good news about your money situation will improve your mood no end today. That does not, however, mean you have an excuse to go on a spree. If you do come into extra cash you must use it to pay off what you still owe.|04-07-2014|pisces
125|If someone needs your help today you will give it with no questions asked. However, after you have saved them yet again you should let them know you are tired of riding to the rescue all the time. They need to take responsibility for themselves.|04-08-2014|pisces
126|If someone changes their plans at the very last moment today you may not be happy about it but you must not let it show. Breath deeply, count to twenty, then give them a big smile and say “no problem”. And never trust them again.|04-09-2014|pisces
127|Try not to get angry or frustrated if a goal you are aiming to reach seems to be further away than ever. Just as there is a reason for everything that happens in life so too is there a reason for everything that does not happen.|04-10-2014|pisces
128|You may have to take a detour of some kind today but that’s okay – you will reach your chosen destination eventually, so don’t be impatient. It’s what you see and hear and feel along the way that makes the journey worth taking.|04-11-2014|pisces
129|If you have any skeletons in your closet – and you do, you do – the surest way to draw attention to them is to try to change the subject when the conversation gets too close to the truth for comfort. Be bold and brazen it out.|04-12-2014|pisces
130|Use your intuition as well as your intellect this week, especially where money matters are concerned. No matter what the facts and figures might say if your sixth sense tells you something is not right you would be a fool not to listen.|04-13-2014|pisces
131|No matter how self-reliant a Pisces you may be you must make an effort to work hand-in-hand with other people over the next few days. Not only will you get more done but you will create a lot of useful goodwill as well.|04-14-2014|pisces
132|You may not be dishonest by nature but you will be tempted to cut corners in some way today – and that could be a big mistake. Any small gains you make by using underhand methods will be wiped out by big losses later on.|04-15-2014|pisces
133|You seem to be a bit reckless of late and if yesterday’s eclipse somehow failed to remind you that’s not a good thing to be then today’s Mars-Mercury link most certainly will. Don’t ignore warnings from your subconscious mind.|04-16-2014|pisces
134|Try not to commit yourself to anything new over the next 24 hours. A range of possibilities will open up for you between now and the start of next week, so conserve your energy and don’t get snowed under by even more responsibilities.|04-17-2014|pisces
135|Sometimes you can be too much of a perfectionist and if you demand the best of other people today you may end up being disappointed. Everyone is different and everyone has their own way of doing things – but, of course, your way is best.|04-18-2014|pisces
136|You are now perfectly placed to put the pressure on those who have been putting so much pressure on you. But that does not mean you should spend all your time getting your own back. The best revenge is being seen to have fun.|04-19-2014|pisces
137|There may be a thousand and one things going on in your world but you should focus only on what makes you smile. Some people think life is so serious but you know it is nothing more than a big cosmic game – and games should be fun.|04-20-2014|pisces
138|Decide what it is that you want to do today, then get on and do it. Chances are you’ll get a few dirty looks, and maybe a few bad words as well, from those who disagree with your aims but there’s nothing they can do to stop you.|04-21-2014|pisces
139|It’s good that you like to work with other people but that does not mean they have the right to dictate to you what you should do and how you should do it. If you are part of a team there must be equality – make sure they know that.|04-22-2014|pisces
140|Sometimes it’s good to get away from your duties and chores and lose yourself in activities you really enjoy. Such a time is now. Mind planet Mercury will make it easy for you to have a good time – not least because you no longer feel guilty about it.|04-23-2014|pisces
141|Someone you meet socially will also attract you romantically but think carefully before you send out signals of love because the planets warn it may not be the right thing to do. Keep it on a friendly level, at least for the moment.|04-24-2014|pisces
142|You will feel good about yourself today, thanks to the influence of Venus, planet of harmony, in your sign. Try to avoid work that may be strenuous, physically or mentally, because it’s unlikely that your heart will be in it.|04-25-2014|pisces
143|You will be on the move this weekend, visiting new places and meeting new people. It’s not often you are this outgoing, so make the most of it and make sure you leave others smiling more when you say goodbye than when you say hello.|04-26-2014|pisces
144|You will be extremely busy at work over the next few days and just as busy socially too and come the end of the week you will no doubt be exhausted. Know when you have reached your limits and reward yourself with a well-earned rest.|04-27-2014|pisces
145|Anyone who thinks you lack the spirit of adventure will have to think again as cosmic activity in the most outgoing area of your chart inspires you to try so many new things. You may do too much but it’s better than doing too little.|04-28-2014|pisces
146|The message of the stars today is that you need to stop wasting time on so many irrelevant activities. Your social life, especially, is becoming a drain on your energy, so cut back on the partying and all those unnecessary commitments.|04-29-2014|pisces
147|Socially this will be a thoroughly enjoyable day but some of your friends may be angry that you are spending more time with new acquaintances than you are with them. They may have a point but you can’t help it if you’re so popular.|04-30-2014|pisces
148|You will discover something about a friend or loved one that surprises you today – which just goes to show you can never be sure you really know another person. Resist the urge to pry any deeper – leave them a few secrets to enjoy.|05-01-2014|pisces
149|You may be tempted to muddle through some kind of problem and hope it all comes right in the end, and maybe it will. But wouldn’t it be easier if you called on the help of an expert? Not even a Pisces can know or do it all.|05-02-2014|pisces
150|You are about to embark on a more light-hearted phase, so try not to worry so much about money and, if the opportunity arises, don’t hesitate to hit the town with your friends. In a nutshell: if you’re not laughing you’re not doing it right.|05-03-2014|pisces
151||05-04-2014|pisces
152|If you recently made a promise, to an employer or somebody else in a position of power, then you must keep it. If you try to back out of the deal it will do your reputation a great deal of harm. Do what you said you would.|05-05-2014|pisces
153|Keep your long-term goals at the forefront of your mind and don’t let anyone put you off your quest. So-called friends will come up with all sorts of reasons why you should think again but you must be true to your instincts.|05-06-2014|pisces
154|You may have to give up something that means a lot to you but you won’t mind too much – in fact you may be secretly happy to see it go. You will be happier still if people just leave you alone for a while. You like your own company.|05-07-2014|pisces
155|Steer clear of disputes that have nothing to do with you. The more others try to draw you into an argument the more you must keep your distance. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to friendships and money – they don’t mix.|05-08-2014|pisces
156|Current cosmic activity endows you with extraordinary self-confidence but the downside is you might start thinking you cannot fail. Apply common sense to everything you do today and don’t let others pressure you into making quick decisions.|05-09-2014|pisces
157|If you have something important to say you are advised to keep quiet about it until the early part of next week. The current Sun-Saturn link warns your words won’t be well received, either by loved ones or people in positions of power.|05-10-2014|pisces
158|Don’t feel guilty about something you did not cause. Yes, the situation maybe a bit of an emotional train wreck but it’s not your fault certain people could not control their impulses. Do what you can to help but don’t take the blame.|05-11-2014|pisces
159|You will be more inclined than usual to take risks. So long as they are calculated risks that’s fine – you will come to no harm and could even make some money – but if you act recklessly the fall could be spectacular. Your choice!|05-12-2014|pisces
160|Travel is on the cards for today and tomorrow but so are hold-ups and unexpected diversions. The good news is that wherever you end up you’ll have a lot of fun, so don’t stay home and play safe – get out into the world.|05-13-2014|pisces
161|Some things in life are important and some things in life are not. Do you know how to tell the difference? Today’s full moon will encourage people to get agitated about issues that are simply not worth the effort. Don’t be one of them.|05-14-2014|pisces
162|Money matters and business affairs will go better today if you turn on the charm and let would-be partners know you are happy to work closely with them. There’s more than enough profit to go around, so don’t be greedy.|05-15-2014|pisces
163|You must let partners and loved ones know what you will and will not put up with. One of the reasons there have been so may arguments of late is that some people have got the impression that you can be easily manipulated.|05-16-2014|pisces
164|Make use of the Sun’s last few days in the most open and outgoing area of your chart to get out into the world and have some fun. No matter how many chores still need to be done they can wait. If it doesn’t make you smile then give it a miss.|05-17-2014|pisces
165|Get back on good terms with someone you have drifted away from in recent months. Start by calling them up and inviting them out for a coffee. Soon you’ll be chatting away like long-lost friends – which, of course, is what you are.|05-18-2014|pisces
166|You are sure to go over the top one way or another over the next 24 hours. Hopefully you will avoid the temptation to spend large sums of money on things you don’t really need. Even things you do need you may pay too much for.|05-19-2014|pisces
167|You may have every right to get angry with someone who has let you down but you will make a better impression if you forgive and forget and act as if nothing important has occurred. In the greater scheme of things, it’s no big deal.|05-20-2014|pisces
168|You may not be in the mood to put yourself out for other people right now but someone is desperately in need of your assistance and you’ll hate yourself in the long-term if you purposely ignore them. It’s your destiny to do good in the world.|05-21-2014|pisces
169|The solution to a problem that has been causing you sleepless nights will pop into your head today and you will kick yourself mentally for not having seen it sooner. Never mind, now you know what to do – so do it.|05-22-2014|pisces
170|Social activities are important, of course, but your home life is what you should be focusing on now. If there are problems in the domestic sphere it’s unlikely you will be happy in other areas, so look for solutions – you’ll find them.|05-23-2014|pisces
171|Even if you are the kind of Pisces who prefers to keep a low profile you will be in the public eye over the next 48 hours – hopefully for the right reasons. This is also an excellent time for artistic activities, so let those creative juices flow.|05-24-2014|pisces
172|There will be times over the next few days when it seems as if what is going on around you is illogical in the extreme. Maybe that’s true but more likely it means you are not in tune with the wider mood. It’s you who needs to adjust.|05-25-2014|pisces
173|You are carrying quite a load at the moment and need to find someone who can help take the strain. The good news is there are a number of people you have done favors for who would like nothing better than to return the compliment.|05-26-2014|pisces
174|Things may be a bit tense on the home front at the moment but over the next two or three days you will get the opportunity to find out why loved ones are so uptight. Once you know that it will be quite easy to restore harmony.|05-27-2014|pisces
175|You need to be more open about your feelings, especially if you are the kind of Pisces who tends to keep your emotions bottled up inside. Every now and then it is good to let things out, to release the pressure so you don’t explode!|05-28-2014|pisces
176|Don’t worry that others might think less of you if you ease off a bit, worry only that if you don’t take better care of yourself you might come to harm. The planets urge you to take things at a slower pace for a while.|05-29-2014|pisces
177|There is a lot of gossip flying about at the moment and there is a danger it could damage your credibility. You must speak up and let others know that what is being said about you is not remotely true. You’re just not that bad.|05-30-2014|pisces
178|All experience is good experience and what happens over the next 48 hours will teach you that even when things go wrong they often go right in some way too. What looks like a loss or a setback now could be a blessing in disguise later on.|05-31-2014|pisces
179|You may be hurting inside but don’t let it show. Put on a brave face, go out and have fun and chances are it won’t be long before you are smiling again. What you think of as “good” and “bad” are often simply a matter of perspective.|06-01-2014|pisces
180|Spell out in plain and simple language what it is you expect of other people. Both at home and at work misunderstandings are likely today, so take your time and make sure everyone knows what they are supposed to be doing.|06-02-2014|pisces
181|Your feelings will be rather intense over the next 24 hours but it need not be an uncomfortable experience. If you prefer to live more through your heart than your head that’s quite all right. Nothing bad will come of it.|06-03-2014|pisces
182|You may not be much in the mood for serious things at the moment but that’s okay. Do what you have to do as quickly as possible, then devote yourself to activities that bring a smile to your face. Life should be about fun, not work.|06-04-2014|pisces
183|Your world will be rocked by what happens over the next few days but later you will look back and realize it was all for the best. Ultimately all change is good for you, so go with the flow and learn equally from success and failure.|06-05-2014|pisces
184|You need to be a bit more adventurous when it comes to your finances. What worked for you in the past may not work as well for you now, so look ahead and find new ways to boost your earning power and your bank balance.|06-06-2014|pisces
185|There is no point trying to change too much today because the upcoming full moon will most likely change them back again. All you can do is go with the flow and trust that in time you will regain the advantage you seem to have lost.|06-07-2014|pisces
186|If you are having second thoughts about taking on a new responsibility you will have to explain yourself to those who thought it was all decided. You may not want to let them down but it’s becoming increasingly likely you may have to.|06-08-2014|pisces
187|Don’t waste your time and energy looking for complicated solutions to what are really quite simple problems. Sometimes you read too much into what is taking place around you and that could well be the case over the next 24 hours.|06-09-2014|pisces
188|You may want to come and go as you please but Saturn, planet of limitation, won’t let you. It seems there is something you need to do before you are allowed to make your getaway. What might it be? Give it some thought – then act.|06-10-2014|pisces
189|The more certain people complain that you are making life difficult for them the more certain you can be that you are doing the right thing. Ultimately, of course, it’s not about making things difficult for them but making things easier for you.|06-11-2014|pisces
190|There are a lot of things going on behind the scenes at the moment and with tomorrow’s new moon adding to the mix you could find yourself involved in all sorts of plots and conspiracies. Make a point of taking none of it too seriously.|06-12-2014|pisces
191|Resist the temptation to tell an employer or senior colleague what you really think of them today – it won’t work out right. If you cannot say something nice then it might be wise to say nothing at all. Think of your future.|06-13-2014|pisces
192|A feud that has been simmering in secret will erupt into open warfare over the weekend and you have no choice but to make it a fight to the finish. Don’t bother trying to compromise – they’ll see that as a sign of weakness.|06-14-2014|pisces
193|Once the Sun moves into the sympathetic sign of Cancer on the 21st a whole new world of possibilities will open up for you, but between now and then you would be wise to relax both physically and mentally. There’s no need to rush.|06-15-2014|pisces
194|You have so much to look forward to – so why are you still looking back and lamenting what might have been? Whatever the reason you need to snap out of it or you may not even notice new opportunities. Be positive – and smile more!|06-16-2014|pisces
195|A friend is clearly being economical with the truth and no doubt that makes you mad. Before you snap at them ask yourself what their motive might be. Maybe they think they are protecting you. Maybe they think you can’t handle the truth.|06-17-2014|pisces
196|Someone you meet on your travels today or tomorrow is destined to play a major role in your life over the next few months. Try not to be too defensive when meeting someone for the first time. Chances are your fates are somehow entwined.|06-18-2014|pisces
197|Once again you are worrying about things you have no way of changing. According to the planets though what you fear the most is the one thing that is least likely to happen, so be brave and go on the attack. You’ll win.|06-19-2014|pisces
198|Fate will take its chosen path no matter what you may think about it, so go with the flow and adapt to what happens rather than try to fight it. One of the best times of the year is about to begin, so you really have nothing to fear.|06-20-2014|pisces
199|The Sun’s entry into the most dynamic area of your chart today is sure to bring a smile to your face. More importantly, it will make you believe that happiness and success are yours by right and not because others choose to give them to you.|06-21-2014|pisces
200|Life is too short to waste time worrying about things that may never happen. Now that the Sun is moving through the most creative area of your chart you can and you must be more decisive and dynamic. Go for it – and make it happen.|06-22-2014|pisces
201|You may not agree with what a friend or family member is going to do but they have made up their mind about it so you might as well give them your support. According to the planets it will all work out well in the end.|06-23-2014|pisces
202|If you know what it is you want and if you act quickly and decisively you are sure to accomplish great things. Someone in a position of authority thinks you are special and they will think you are even more special after today!|06-24-2014|pisces
203|Sometimes it is better to back off from a fight and with Mars opposing Uranus today this is definitely one of them. Let others argue the toss and put the world to rights – your talents are better suited to loving and laughing.|06-25-2014|pisces
204|The approaching new moon falls in the most dynamic area of your chart, so you won’t hesitate to take advantage of what happens over the next few days. Just remember that some things matter and some things do not. Use your energy wisely.|06-26-2014|pisces
205|Today’s new moon in the most dynamic area of your chart endows you with so much confidence and so much energy. Whatever you put your mind to will be a success. But don’t do too much and spread yourself too thin. Be selective.|06-27-2014|pisces
206|The Sun in Cancer at this time of year makes you hugely creative, so do something out of the ordinary over the next 48 hours, something that cannot fail to get you noticed. It won’t be long before your name is up in lights.|06-28-2014|pisces
207|If there are any doubts in your mind about what you are planning to do they will be gone by the middle of the week. The planets will get you thinking more deeply than usual about your lifestyle and, more specifically, about your relationships.|06-29-2014|pisces
208|Over the next two or three days the planets will bring to a head issues that you have been trying to avoid. Once you realize you can no longer run away from them you will have to look for solutions – and there will be plenty.|06-30-2014|pisces
209|It’s not often you reveal your darkest secrets but you will be tempted to do so today. Is that such a good idea? Some things are not meant to be shared, not even if you are desperate to cleanse your conscience. Forgive yourself and move on.|07-01-2014|pisces
210|Your confidence seems to be making a return now that mind planet Mercury is no longer such a negative influence, and by the end of the week you will be the life and soul of the party again. Welcome back – we’ve missed you.|07-02-2014|pisces
211|Feelings you have been keeping hidden inside you will burst out for the whole world to see today and, yes, it will be a bit embarrassing. But better to be embarrassed than to go on pretending you don’t care. You always care.|07-03-2014|pisces
212|For some strange reason you seem to be afraid of your own shadow – even though most things in your life are going well. Don’t let fear hold you back from doing something creative today. Once you get started your confidence will return.|07-04-2014|pisces
213|You need to strike a workable balance this weekend between protecting your own interests and not being too greedy. What you, and everyone else, need to understand is that there is more than enough to go around. There always is.|07-05-2014|pisces
214|Don’t let fear of the unknown hold you back over the next seven days. The planets indicate you won’t have to face anything worse than you have faced before, and you’re still here and thriving, aren’t you? So why worry?|07-06-2014|pisces
215|If an issue is causing you sleepless nights the best way to deal with it is to focus your mind on something else for a while. Eventually you may find that you no longer care who wins and who loses. It’s just not important.|07-07-2014|pisces
216|You need to get your act together and get something started today. If you don’t you may spend the rest of the year kicking yourself for being too slow and too cautious. Don’t be afraid of change – change is your friend and ally.|07-08-2014|pisces
217|The message of the stars is that you must finish what you started. If you give up on a project now you will regret it later in the year when you realize how close you were to success. You’re actually doing very well, so stay the course.|07-09-2014|pisces
218|With both the Sun and Jupiter moving through the most dynamic area of your chart there is precious little you cannot do now, but you will do it better if you are part of a team. It’s always more fun when there’s more than one.|07-10-2014|pisces
219|There is no point worrying about things over which you have no control. The good news is that even if the worst does happen today it won’t be as bad as you fear. Even if you lose out you will still win in some way.|07-11-2014|pisces
220|The current cosmic climate will play havoc with everyone’s plans over the next 48 hours, so take life as it comes and don’t expect too much of anyone, including yourself. When little things do go right it will be a pleasant surprise.|07-12-2014|pisces
221|Jupiter, planet of expansion, moves into the most practical area of your chart this week, so focus on everyday matters and make sure that each and every time you exert yourself you balance it with plenty of rest. Your health is important.|07-13-2014|pisces
222|If you respect other people they will respect you – it’s as simple as that. If, however, you say or do things that others find offensive you can expect some kind of backlash. As with each and every other issue in your life, the choice is your own.|07-14-2014|pisces
223|All things are possible if you want them enough and if you believe in yourself. If you can keep that thought at the forefront of your mind today you might just accomplish something out of the ordinary because you are anything but ordinary.|07-15-2014|pisces
224|You will be back to your best in a matter of days but today you must make peace with anyone you have fallen out with. Maybe you were a little harsh on them. Maybe you should have been more forgiving. So forgive them now.|07-16-2014|pisces
225|The cosmic omens are so good for you at the moment that you no doubt think you can do as you please. To a certain extent that is true but you should do things for other people as well. Neptune, your ruler, urges you to be charitable.|07-17-2014|pisces
226|You will feel SO affectionate today – you’re in love with the whole wide world. It won’t last, of course, but while it does see how many good deeds you can do for friends, relatives and even strangers. You’ll make such a difference.|07-18-2014|pisces
227|If you allow others to distract you today you will get very little done and that would be a shame. You have so much going for you now. There are so many opportunities. You cannot afford to be sidetracked by petty issues and petty people.|07-19-2014|pisces

237|Let loved ones make their own decisions for a change. Too often in the past you have done everything for them and it has got to the stage where they expect it of you. That’s not good for you or for them, so break the cycle.|07-29-2014|pisces
238|If a friend or work colleague says something hurtful don’t take it to heart. On the contrary, you should take it as a sign that you are on the right track. They obviously feel threatened, so keep doing what you’re doing, only more so!|07-30-2014|pisces
239|It may annoy you that a friend or work colleague insists on everything being done their way but if you are smart you will go along with them. If it’s a success you will share in the glory. If it’s a failure it’s entirely their fault.|07-31-2014|pisces

243|You will be bombarded with advice from every direction today and a lot of it will be contradictory. Chances are you can learn from what others are telling you but first you will need to filter the good advice from the garbage.|08-04-2014|pisces
244|Be positive and believe in yourself – then act decisively. The current cosmic picture makes it easy for you to boost both your status and your earning power, but it won’t just happen as if by magic – the effort must come from you.|08-05-2014|pisces
245|Others may say that you have got something all wrong but you must not allow them to change your opinion. Just because you are in the minority at the moment does not mean you are wrong. You’ve never been one to follow the herd.|08-06-2014|pisces
246|Something will get under your skin to such an extent today that you may get a bit fanatical about it. Yes, of course, it is interesting and yes, of course, it is important but don’t shout and scream about it or you will turn people off.|08-07-2014|pisces
247|You may be the sort who spends more time dreaming than doing but today the planets will inspire you to take a more hands-on approach. Anything of a practical nature will go well for you, so get your act together and get things done.|08-08-2014|pisces

251|Only you can decide if a relationship is worth carrying on with but you don’t have to decide right now. The planets indicate there are still a few twists and turns and surprises to come, so stay calm and don’t do anything rash.|08-12-2014|pisces
252|Some things are worth fighting about but others are not and over the next few days you will need to get serious about where you draw the line. Fight only for what you truly believe in. Better still, find ways to win without fighting at all.|08-13-2014|pisces
253|A robust set of influences will make you somewhat vocal over the next 48 hours and that’s good. You should never be shy about putting across your point of view, especially when you know it’s the right view. Speak up, loudly.|08-14-2014|pisces

255|You may want to back out of some kind of joint activity but if you do there are sure to be consequences. Before you make the fateful cut try to find ways you can make it work. If you can’t see any, try looking harder!|08-16-2014|pisces
256|Yes, of course, you should turn the other cheek and forgive those who have spoken or acted in ways that hurt you, but you must also let them know that you won’t be so forgiving next time. Your good nature can be abused only so far.|08-17-2014|pisces
257|You must be totally honest today, even if what you have to say is not what colleagues and loved ones want to hear. Don’t worry about their reactions – worry about how guilty you will feel if you keep quiet and it all goes wrong.|08-18-2014|pisces
258|Focus only on things that excite you physically and emotionally over the next few days. There will, of course, be those who say you are expecting too much of yourself but, on the contrary, if anything you are not expecting enough.|08-19-2014|pisces
259|Sometimes you can be rather stubborn and that could be a problem today if you refuse to abandon an idea that clearly is no longer worth defending. Times change and you should be big enough and smart enough to change with them.|08-20-2014|pisces

265|You may want nothing more than to pack a bag and get away from it all for a while but the fact is you have duties and responsibilities that demand your attention. See to them now and come the weekend you can make your getaway at last.|08-27-2014|pisces
266|You may feel obliged to favor one thing over another but is it really for the best? The planets indicate you have been pushed in that direction by people who have a vested interest in what you do. Make choices for yourself, not for them.|08-28-2014|pisces
267|Others may say you are not being serious enough about what’s going on in the world but you are under no obligation to feel guilty about things you did not cause. The world would be a better place if others were more like you.|08-29-2014|pisces
268|If you feel that certain things need changing then you must make those changes yourself. It may make you unpopular with those who want things to stay as they are but you’ve never been the type to worry about what others think.|08-30-2014|pisces
269|You have so many good ideas but you can’t seem to make a serious start on any of them. Maybe that’s your problem, maybe you are trying to do too many things. Put all your energy into the one thing that matters most this week. |08-31-2014|pisces
270|Some people take it for granted that they can get what they need from you any time they want. Why? Because that’s the impression you have given them by being too soft. It’s time to get tough. Go on, you can do it if you try.|09-01-2014|pisces
271|You don’t lack for confidence but just lately you seem to have been missing the essential ingredient of luck that every successful person needs. Don’t worry: what happens over the next few days will be very much to your benefit.|09-02-2014|pisces
272|Make an effort to see things from another person’s point of view today. You may be surprised to find that the way they look at the world is not that far away from your own. Differences are rarely more than skin deep.|09-03-2014|pisces

274|Love planet Venus in your opposite sign will bring relationship issues to the fore, but in a nice way. If you are single it’s quite possible you will get together with someone compatible over the weekend. Try not to scare them away!|09-05-2014|pisces
275|Don’t put all your eggs in one basket this weekend because there is a very good chance you will lose them all. Spread your time and your energy and, most importantly, your money, in several directions. Overall you’ll gain more than you lose.|09-06-2014|pisces
276|Many of the decisions you make in life are based on intuition rather than reason and that’s okay because it seems to work for you. Sometimes though you need to be strictly logical and that’s where you are now. You must use your head.|09-07-2014|pisces

278|Today’s Venus-Neptune link suggests you are likely to lose focus and start wandering around with no idea what direction you should be heading. No change there then! Actually it doesn’t matter – fate will always guide you where you need to go.|09-10-2014|pisces
279|You may not be in the least bit interested what someone is trying to tell you but if you are smart you will listen and nod your head wisely at the appropriate moments. You need to keep in with this person, even of they secretly bore you.|09-11-2014|pisces
280|You need to give up on a personal vendetta. Even if you are 10 per cent in the right and your enemy is 100 per cent in the wrong it doesn’t matter – confrontations like this are not worth it. Let it go – you’ll feel better for it.|09-12-2014|pisces
281|As Mars moves into the career area of your chart this weekend you will come under pressure from people who have a great deal of influence. Rise to the occasion and make an effort to impress them. You can never have too many powerful allies.|09-13-2014|pisces
282|What seems so obvious to you is obviously difficult for someone else to grasp, so take time out of your busy schedule and help them “get it”. They will appreciate the effort you make on their behalf. Maybe one day they’ll explain something to you. |09-14-2014|pisces
283|You need to resolve a dispute with a loved one or work colleague and you need to do it right now. If you let the situation fester for even one more day it may move beyond the point where it is easily rescued. Say sorry, and move on.|09-15-2014|pisces
284|There are so many serious things going on around you at the moment that others are unlikely to be in the mood for fun and games. That’s okay, you can entertain yourself well enough. You’re certainly not going to join in all the doom and gloom!|09-16-2014|pisces
285|Neptune, your ruler, is linked with mind planet Mercury today, so your brain will be buzzing with big ideas. But are they practical ideas? For best results you should limit yourself to one or two objectives you know you can easily reach.|09-17-2014|pisces
286|You know what you want and you know how to get it. So what are you waiting for? The time is right to make your bid for fame and fortune, so don’t hold back a moment longer: show the world you’re a force to be reckoned with.|09-18-2014|pisces
287|The best way to deal with a negative situation is to ignore it. No, really. The more you focus on what’s going wrong the longer it will stick around, so starve it of the oxygen of attention and see how fast it shrinks in importance.|09-19-2014|pisces
288|Be careful what you say today because certain people will take you seriously, maybe more seriously than you intended. On the work front especially don’t give rivals a stick with which they can beat you. Sometimes you’re your own worst enemy.|09-20-2014|pisces
289|No doubt there are certain individuals you would like to be on better terms with but would that really change things? Probably not. The real problem is that you don’t stand up for yourself enough. It’s time to get tough. Bite back.|09-21-2014|pisces
290|An issue you had either forgotten about or you thought had been resolved will return to annoy you today and this time you have got to deal with it effectively. Show those who doubt it that you can be decisive. Make your call and make it happen.|09-22-2014|pisces
291|No matter what you do over the next 24 hours you are sure to tread on someone’s toes and get criticized for it. No matter. Better to be clumsy and get noticed than to make all the right moves and fail to make an impression.|09-23-2014|pisces
292|No matter what problems you may have faced in recent weeks they are just about played out and after today won’t trouble you again. No doubt a celebration is in order but don’t go mad and spend all your money – keep plenty in reserve.|09-24-2014|pisces
293|The planets suggest you are about to make a momentous decision, the kind that could change the whole course of your life. But are you making it for the right reasons? Make sure you answer that question honestly before taking the next step.|09-25-2014|pisces
294|Someone you live or work with will be irritable in the extreme over the next 24 hours. There is no point trying to reason with them or cheer them up because the fact is they enjoy being negative. Just stay out of their way as much as you can.|09-26-2014|pisces
295|It may be true that the world is changing quicker by the day but that does not mean you should slavishly follow each new fashion. Some things about the old ways are still worth keeping, so don’t be afraid to swim against the tide.|09-27-2014|pisces
296|If you feel a bit down as the new week begins you should get involved in some kind of charity or social work. Seeing other people’s problems will put your own in perspective – and you’ll feel good about yourself because you can help.|09-28-2014|pisces
297|Sometimes you can be too generous for your own good and cosmic activity in the wealth area of your chart warns you need to keep an eye on your finances. Help people out if you can but don’t ruin yourself in the process.|09-29-2014|pisces
298|There will be moments today when you wonder if your efforts are truly appreciated but don’t let the apparent indifference of friends and loved ones get you down. Maybe they are just too busy to think about anything but their own needs.|09-30-2014|pisces
299|You may not be able to make much sense of what is taking place around you but that does not matter. The important thing is that you are clear in your mind what it is you are trying to do. Outer confusion must yield to inner composure.|10-01-2014|pisces
300|Act on the assumption that there is no such thing as chance. If something unusual happens today there is sure to be a reason for it and your job is to find out what it is. Why? Simply because it’s fun to be in the know.|10-02-2014|pisces
301|Say what you mean over the next 24 hours but be extremely careful how you say it. With Mercury about to start one of its retrograde phases if others don’t like your tone of voice you could find you have made unnecessary enemies.|10-03-2014|pisces
302|You may want to end the woes of the world but you are smart enough to realize it isn’t going to happen. What you can do though is change yourself. Change your own life for the better in some small way and others will follow your lead.|10-04-2014|pisces
303|According to the planets you may be feeling a bit sorry for yourself at the moment. You need to snap out of it because there are all sorts of great opportunities heading your way and if you are drowning in tears you may miss them.|10-05-2014|pisces
304|You may dislike having to admit that you were wrong about something but if you can’t bring yourself to do it now the lunar eclipse in midweek will make your error look even worse. So you made a mistake – so what? Accept it and move on.|10-06-2014|pisces

307|Your imagination could easily run away with you today, especially if you are having second thoughts about a long-term project, but don’t let yourself get too detached from reality. Overall everything is still moving in the right direction, so lighten up.|10-09-2014|pisces
308|You won’t escape a difficult situation by running away from it, so be brave and face up to whatever emotional challenge is in front of you. Chances are when you look it squarely in the face you will see there was nothing to fear in the first place.|10-10-2014|pisces
309|Someone who envies your abilities has been trying to make life difficult for you in recent weeks and will be at it again over the next 48 hours. Ignore them. Pretend they don’t exist. The world will only take them seriously if you take them seriously.|10-11-2014|pisces
310|The joy you get out of a relationship far outweighs the annoying things that sometimes come with it, so don’t you dare think of calling it a day. Deep down you share an almost spiritual attachment. End it and you’ll harm a part of yourself as well. |10-12-2014|pisces
311|Someone who should know you better has got it into their head that you no longer like them and that is why they are behaving so erratically at the moment. Do whatever it takes to ease their fears. You’re still friends and always will be.|10-13-2014|pisces
312|Financial security may be uppermost in your mind at the moment but there are other things you need to take into consideration. One is how much extra work you will have to do for that extra cash you need. Don’t run yourself into the ground.|10-14-2014|pisces

315|The planets warn you will have to make sacrifices in your social life today and over the weekend if you are to make progress in more serious areas. On the work front especially aim to do more than your rivals – a lot more.|10-17-2014|pisces
316|The Sun’s change of signs this week means you must be true to your principles, even if you are the only one who believes in them! You may be easygoing but there are some things you will never compromise, for money, love or anything else.|10-19-2014|pisces

323|Neptune, your ruler, governs insight and inspiration, and those are traits you will have plenty of during the early part of the week. You will also have more love in your life than usual, as romance planet Venus is strong as well. Enjoy! |10-26-2014|pisces
324|The reason you feel stuck at the moment is because you don’t have a clear idea what it is you are aiming for. Your first and, if necessary, your only task today is to identify your goal and draw up a plan that will take you to it.|10-27-2014|pisces
325|Don’t worry too much about how you are going to do what has to be done, just greet the day with a smile and let your intuition guide you. This is one of the best times of the year for you, so try not to make it unnecessarily complicated.|10-28-2014|pisces

331|The planets warn that your critical faculties are not what they should be at the moment, so try not to get too excited if certain people make you remarkable offers. It’s highly unlikely they are in a position to deliver. |11-05-2014|pisces
332|Today’s full moon indicates that you are torn between opposing options, unable to decide which is the right way to go. Toss a coin if you have to but be sure to choose a path and stick to it. Any way is better than no way at all.|11-06-2014|pisces

344|It may at times seem as if you are the only one who thinks logically but something will convince you today that you are not alone, that others share your values and opinions. Even if they don’t it doesn’t matter – you’re right and that’s it|11-20-2014|pisces
345|If there is something you want to say then now is the time to say it. It does not matter how many people your words may offend, you have a duty to tell the truth as you see it – and the fact is you see it better than most.|11-21-2014|pisces
346|You may feel you don’t have what it takes to fill a certain role but that isn’t true and with the Sun and moon highlighting the career area of your chart this weekend you really must have more confidence in yourself. Don’t think, just go for it. |11-22-2014|pisces
347|The best way to approach a work problem is to act as if it is not a problem at all. A confrontational attitude will only cause more discord, so pretend that everything is sweetness and light and, in time, maybe it will be.|11-23-2014|pisces
348|It may be tempting to confront someone who has been giving you a hard time but the planets warn you should leave it until later in the week. Mercury’s change of signs on Friday is the signal to speak up – and answer back.|11-24-2014|pisces
349|You know exactly what needs to be said or done to restore harmony at home or at work, so get on with it. The people you have fallen out with want to get things back to normal too, so make the first move and let them respond. |11-25-2014|pisces
350|You may be convinced that you are in the right about something but the planets warn you should not push your case too hard over the next 24 hours. If others can’t see the truth then they are the ones most likely to suffer for it.|11-26-2014|pisces
351|Someone is clearly determined to make your life difficult but you won’t overcome them by direct confrontation. Find ways you can influence their behavior in more subtle ways. Is there something you know about them you can use as a lever? |11-27-2014|pisces
352|What happens today will give you the sense of perspective you have been lacking in recent weeks. You may have to admit, if only to yourself, that a wrong turning has been taken. It’s no big deal – the journey matters more than the destination.|11-28-2014|pisces
353|You may be eager to push ahead with a new plan or project but it seems not everyone shares your enthusiasm. Should that worry you? No it should not. In fact on this occasion it is probably better if you travel alone. |11-29-2014|pisces
354|It may be the case that someone is holding back information and not letting you in on what you need to know. You are well aware who that someone is, the question is: what are you going to do about it? Find out the details from another source.|11-30-2014|pisces
355|You like to do things to help other people and you will get the opportunity today. However, with mind planet Mercury at odds with your ruler Neptune make sure those you help really are in need, and not just faking it! |12-01-2014|pisces
356|The Sun in Sagittarius has a tendency to make you fret about your career but there is really no need. Whatever changes may be happening in your working environment they will be good for you in the long-term, so quit worrying.  |12-02-2014|pisces
357|What are your expectations? Are they realistic? It is important that you think about these questions because over the next few days your goals are sure to be challenged. Don’t be afraid to change them if they don’t come up to scratch.|12-03-2014|pisces
358|What occurs over the next 24 hours will remind you that not everything in life is as permanent or predictable as you might like it to be. That may sound ominous but don’t worry – changes will be very much to your liking. |12-04-2014|pisces
359|Most likely you will exchange a few heated words with someone today and the bad feeling will continue through the weekend. But it’s no big deal. Full moons have a way of raising tensions and it will all be over come the start of next week. |12-05-2014|pisces
360|If it annoys you that someone seems determined to get you involved in an issue you have no real interest in then maybe you should be blunt and tell them to give it a rest. You are under no obligation to support their cause.|12-06-2014|pisces
361|Honesty is not only the best policy for the upcoming week, it is the only policy if you are to earn the trust of other people. Don’t worry that what you have to say may sound harsh or ungrateful, just say it and welcome the consequences.|12-07-2014|pisces
362|You may be one of the more sensitive members of the zodiac but you can be tough when the occasion calls for it, and it will call for it today. On the work front especially others will get the message that you’re not such a wimp after all. |12-08-2014|pisces
363|You need to deal with a situation that has been bothering you for several weeks. It may require you to make a decision that is in some way final (and that scares you) but what can you do when the alternative is more sleepless nights? |12-09-2014|pisces
364|Put your worries behind you and have fun with your friends. Some people, inevitably, will say you are neglecting your responsibilities but you can safely ignore them. You desperately need to take a break – and few would dispute you deserve it.|12-10-2014|pisces
365|The more others say that what you are trying to do is impossible the more determined you will be to prove them wrong. Your confidence may waver a bit towards the end of the day but by then you should have reached your goal. |12-11-2014|pisces
366|You don’t have to pretend that a certain task comes easy to you when, in fact, it is a major struggle. No one expects you to get it right the first time, so do your best and be pleased with that. Others will be pleased with you too. |12-12-2014|pisces
367|Whatever you are working on this weekend you are advised to pace yourself sensibly because if you get carried away and move too fast you could run out of steam before the project is finished. There’s no rush, so don’t impose unnecessary deadlines.|12-13-2014|pisces
368|The planets warn you need to be careful where money and business matters are concerned. You should be especially cautious about what profits you can expect. You know the old saying: don’t count your chickens before they have hatched.|12-14-2014|pisces
369|A rival will throw down a challenge today and if you are smart you will pick it up and throw it right back at them. Most likely they will be so surprised that they immediately back off. If they don’t, you must back up your words with action. |12-15-2014|pisces
370|You may have to react to a series of minor crises today. Eventually it will dawn on you that most of them are of your own making, but will you wise up before you have wasted an entire day’s worth of time and energy? |12-16-2014|pisces
371|Anyone who dares to disagree with you today is going to wish they had kept their opinions to themselves. You are in no mood to listen to criticism, not even from those whose input you value. You know what you are doing. |12-17-2014|pisces
372|You won’t find it hard to persuade partners and colleagues to follow your lead today but make sure it is persuade – not force. If you push others in directions they don’t want to go they will drag their feet and kick up an embarrassing fuss. |12-18-2014|pisces
373|You can use your power to force someone to do your bidding today, or you can use your charm to persuade them to cooperate. It’s up to you which you choose but common sense says the latter is likely to be less problematic.|12-19-2014|pisces
374|If you make a wish over the next 48 hours there is every chance that it will come true early in the new year. The cosmic vibrations are working very much in your favor at the moment, so wish away. What have you got to lose?|12-20-2014|pisces
375|The more you focus on a problem the more of a problem it seems to become – so why not ignore it for a while and see what happens? Chances are you will forget all about it before the week is more than a few hours old.|12-21-2014|pisces
376|You will get the red carpet treatment wherever you go today – everyone thinks you are special. But you cannot possibly accept every invitation that comes your way, so be selective and don’t worry if you have to let some people down. |12-22-2014|pisces
377|If you find it hard to discuss things in a civilized manner with certain people then the best thing to do is to stay out of their way. You may have the best arguments but they don’t want to be told, so don’t waste your time on them. |12-23-2014|pisces
378|You will find your second wind in the final few days of the year but right now you are advised to take life at a sensible pace, especially if you are hosting friends and family over the holiday period. Don’t try to do everything yourself. |12-24-2014|pisces
379|You are brimming with confidence at the moment and your rampant self-belief will make things happen as if by magic. No task is too much, no challenge is too tough. You will find yourself surrounded by admirers and wannabe new friends. |12-25-2014|pisces
380|Neptune in your birth sign means you are at your best when you let the caring, sharing side of your nature come to the fore. Don’t worry that some people might take advantage of you – that’s a problem for their conscience, not yours. |12-26-2014|pisces
381|Whatever upheavals you were forced to go through in recent weeks the worst is now definitely over and what happens over the next 48 hours will give you cause to believe that 2015 will start on a high note. It’s okay to smile. |12-27-2014|pisces
382|If your sixth sense tells you that something is not quite right over the next few days you must listen to it and take extra care. Facts and figures may tell you one thing but they should never be allowed to overrule your intuition.|12-28-2014|pisces
383|You are worrying about something that on most other occasions would not bother you in the slightest. It could be you are imagining things but more likely it is your inner voice trying to tell you something important. So listen.|12-29-2014|pisces
384|It’s not your way to be overtly ambitious but an event has inspired you and you are determined to make something good of it in the new year. Set your sights high and promise yourself that whatever obstacles you face you will triumph in the end. |12-30-2014|pisces
385|Don’t let friends or relatives pressure you into doing something you don’t care for today. See in the new year the way you want to see it in, even if it means turning down a party invitation that everyone else is buzzing about. |12-31-2014|pisces
386|According to the planets you need to be less forgiving today, especially when dealing with people who clearly could not care less about your feelings. Start the new year the way you mean to go on: put your own interests first on every occasion. |01-01-2015|pisces
387|A new year is a great time for starting something fresh, especially if it involves other people and in some way or other expands your understanding of the world. A new hobby will bring a great deal of pleasure over the next few weeks. |01-02-2015|pisces
388|You may find it hard to trust other people but if you let go and let friends and work colleagues guide you then the next few days will bring some nice surprises. Not even a Pisces can know it all or do it all, so lighten up. |01-03-2015|pisces
389|Someone you have worked well with on creative projects in the past may not be so easy to work with over the next few days, but don’t let it worry you. Maybe you both need to do your own thing for a while. |01-04-2015|pisces
390|Certain things in your world are changing and there is nothing you can do to stop it. Nor is there any reason why you should want to. Be positive and believe that what happens is for the best, for you and for everyone.|01-05-2015|pisces
391|Mixed signals are likely today and you could find yourself laughing when others expected you to be sad. It may be embarrassing but no great harm will come of it so long as you say sorry the moment you realize you got it wrong.|01-06-2015|pisces
392|The most important thing now is that you have faith in your own abilities, even if some people have made it clear they think you are taking on too much. Success depends on may things but most of all it depends on confidence. |01-07-2015|pisces
393|Even if you are the kind of Pisces who tends to keep your opinions to yourself you won’t hesitate to speak your mind today – and quite right too. The one thing you can’t stand is injustice and you won’t turn a blind eye to it.|01-08-2015|pisces
394|Everyone wants to please you, everyone wants to be your friend, which is nice. But don’t let it blind you to the fact that you may have to make some unpopular calls over the next few days. “Nice” doesn’t pay the bills. |01-09-2015|pisces
395|If you find your way blocked over the next 48 hours just use your imagination and find a way to go round the obstacle. There is no set path for the journey you are on, so be bold and try something different. It will be fun.|01-10-2015|pisces
396|With Mars moving into your sign on Monday you will have no trouble thinking fast and acting fast. And that’s because you don’t have time to hang around – you have important things to accomplish and the clock never stops ticking.|01-11-2015|pisces
397|Something you start over the next few days is destined to be of major importance to you over the coming year. Mars in your signs means you will outshine rivals and make a name for yourself. Make sure you are famous – not infamous. |01-12-2015|pisces
398|The message of the stars today is that you should finish what you have already begun rather than start something new. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your working environment. Call a halt to new commitments.|01-13-2015|pisces
399|You will receive good news today but for some strange reason you may find it hard to believe. The planets indicate that no one is trying to deceive you, so take what you hear on trust and, more importantly, act on it. |01-14-2015|pisces
400|With Mars in your sign you refuse to accept second best, which is good, but as Mars squares up to limitations planet Saturn today you do have to recognize that people in positions of power need to be respected – and sometimes obeyed. |01-15-2015|pisces
401|If someone tries to do you a favor don’t automatically assume that it’s some kind of scam. Despite what the headlines might suggest there are still a lot of genuine people out there in the world and you will meet one of them today. |01-16-2015|pisces
402|You are determined to be useful. You are determined to make a difference. Which is great, of course, but be selective about what you do and who you help this weekend. Not every cause, or person, is worthy or your assistance. |01-17-2015|pisces
403|You will be in a thoughtful mood during the early part of the week and that’s good because the more you think things through now the more likely it is they will go right for you later. Good thoughts are never wasted.|01-18-2015|pisces
404|You may not be your usual sociable self today but in a way that’s good because you need to spend some time in your own company. Think about the direction your life is going – and consider what changes may be necessary later in the year. |01-19-2015|pisces
405|You will be in a thoughtful mood today and that’s good because the more you think about certain issues now the more likely it is they will work out for you later. Good thoughts, like good deeds, are seldom wasted. |01-20-2015|pisces
406|Do you listen to someone who claims to know what is going on or do you listen to that small voice inside your head that says they are talking rubbish? You know the answer to that one already. Trust your instincts today. |01-21-2015|pisces
407|Make it your aim over the next two or three days to finish something you started a long time ago. You may have to shut yourself away and be unsociable for a while but you really do need to focus and get it done.|01-22-2015|pisces
408|If you have a secret – and you do – you must keep it to yourself. It may be about someone you don’t really care about but if it becomes public knowledge you will be the one who gets blamed for the consequences.|01-23-2015|pisces
409|This won’t be a wild weekend for you – in fact it will be rather sedate. That’s okay, in fact it’s good. A lot has happened in recent weeks and you need time to mentally and emotionally digest the meaning of it all. Take your time. |01-24-2015|pisces
410|The entry of Venus into your sign on Tuesday means that life is going to get a lot better over the next few weeks. Always do your best and always think the best of other people, even though they sometimes do stupid things. |01-25-2015|pisces
411|You will have to deal with someone’s negative emotions today, without getting negative or emotional yourself. Whatever happens, either at home or at work, keep smiling and keep believing that your life is charmed – because it is. |01-26-2015|pisces
412|Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your sign today and almost immediately you will feel a sense of relief. Has anything actually changed? In the physical sense, probably not, but mentally and emotionally you are far more balanced.|01-27-2015|pisces
413|The course of action you are about to take won’t meet with everyone’s approval but you don’t care about that. Too many times in the past you let other people’s opinions affect your ambitions – but this time you’re doing it your way. |01-28-2015|pisces
414|Put the past behind you and start again with a more positive attitude. Get over any guilt feelings you have about the things you should have done – and the things you should not have done. Life is for love and laughs, not tears. |01-29-2015|pisces
415|Your luck is well and truly in at the moment and if you don’t believe that now you will believe it over the weekend. Ask yourself what you would attempt to do if you knew that success was guaranteed – then do it and enjoy the rewards. |01-30-2015|pisces
416|You are good at some things but not so good at others, so focus on the former and let the latter take care of themselves. No one expects you to be an expert at everything so why expect it of yourself? Delegate what you’re not good at. |01-31-2015|pisces
417|You will know instinctively this week if what you are being told is the truth or a lie. Your sixth sense is so sharp that you pick up the tiniest changes in tone and body language. No lie detector machine is as sensitive as you!|02-01-2015|pisces
418|If someone annoys you today just turn your back and walk away. If you allow yourself to get drawn into an argument you will get angry and say things you might later wish you had kept to yourself. They’re not worth the hassle. |02-02-2015|pisces
419|You may be convinced that your way of looking at something is correct but someone else is equally convinced that they are right and you are wrong. If you can agree to disagree, fine. If not, stay out of their way. |02-03-2015|pisces
420|The only thing you are interested in now is the truth and you will do whatever it takes to get it. Maybe that is why certain people look so worried. Maybe they don’t want you to know what they have been up to!|02-04-2015|pisces
421|You owe someone a favor and you will be expected to repay it over the next 24 hours. There may be other things you would prefer to be doing but they went out of their way for you so do the same for them. |02-05-2015|pisces
422|You may feel a bit run down today but don’t let it worry you because things are not as bad as they seem. What little things can you do to make yourself feel comfortable? Then do them. It’s the little things that matter. |02-06-2015|pisces
423|Anything to do with love or art or beauty will go well for you this weekend. Venus in your sign, allied to passion planet Pluto, will inspire you to give of your best in any and every way possible. Be amazing.|02-07-2015|pisces
424|Don’t bother asking other people for their ideas this week because all you will get is a dozen or more conflicting opinions. Be brave and follow what your instincts tell you, even if it turns everyone else against you. |02-08-2015|pisces
425|You need to explain to friends and relatives why you have done certain things. What your motives were is actually of secondary importance, what matters most is that they can see it is part of some kind of plan and not just random.  |02-09-2015|pisces
426|Someone will be vocal in their criticism of you today but there is no need to get alarmed, still less to get angry, because they mean well. Listen to what they have to say and accept that at least some their criticisms are valid. |02-10-2015|pisces
427|You will learn something you find hard to believe today but there it is in front of you and cannot be denied. It has in fact been in plain sight for quite a while, which begs the question: how did you manage to miss it. |02-11-2015|pisces
428|No matter how many things you may have on the go at work you must take care of the needs of loved ones first. You may be intensely ambitious but if your home life isn’t happy it’s unlikely you will be at your best.|02-12-2015|pisces
429|If you need to be alone with your thoughts by all means go off on your own for a while. You don’t have to make excuses to those who were hoping for the pleasure of your company. It’s good to keep them wanting more.|02-13-2015|pisces
430|There is a danger now that you could be a little too confident about money matters and start spending the stuff as if your bank account is a bottomless well. It isn’t. At the very least keep something in reserve to cover unexpected bills.|02-14-2015|pisces
431|The Sun moves into your birth sign on Wednesday and from that day on your confidence and your lust for life will come flooding back. Don’t think you have to do everything at once though – pace yourself sensibly throughout the week. |02-15-2015|pisces
432|Your outlook on life will change beyond recognition over the next few days. In recent weeks you have questioned your aims and ambitions and come to the conclusion that you should be aiming much higher. Strive to reach your full potential.|02-16-2015|pisces
433|Your energy levels are high but you can’t seem to decide what you should be doing with it all. That’s okay, in fact it’s good. The Sun’s move into your sign tomorrow will bring new challenges and new opportunities. Today, rest while you can. |02-17-2015|pisces
434|This is a hugely important day for you. Not only is there a new moon but the Sun’s move into your sign means a new start is possible. How and where in your life would you like to wipe the slate clean? So do it!|02-18-2015|pisces
435|If you are asked to give more than you think is fair today you must speak up about it. Let others know you are not an easy touch and you will not be taken for a ride. If it means you fall out with someone, so be it. |02-19-2015|pisces
436|You may lose your cool about something that on most occasions would not bother you in the slightest. If you do flare up for no good reason calm down as quickly as you can and have the good grace to admit you went over the top.|02-20-2015|pisces
437|Start something new this weekend, something that is likely to bring you fame and fortune later in the year. Positive activity in your birth sign means the universe is very much on your side at the moment. Milk it for all it is worth! |02-21-2015|pisces
438|The Sun in your birth sign suggests that if you want to change your life for the better you won’t be short of options over the coming week. The most important thing is that you forget about the past and think only of the future. Be positive. |02-22-2015|pisces
439|Don’t worry if your latest project does not seem to be making much progress – there is a good cosmic reason why you are being held back. Most likely you need to let the idea mature in your mind for a little while longer. |02-23-2015|pisces
440|If someone asks you to help with a cause that is close to your heart you will, of course, do so eagerly. But before you part with your time or your cash find out if they know what they are doing. Deal with professionals, not amateurs.|02-24-2015|pisces
441|Something that has been worrying you for ages will worry you no longer come the end of the week. Cosmic activity in and around your birth sign means your outlook on life is changing for the better. Your worries are not worth worrying about.|02-25-2015|pisces
442|You will get advice from all directions today and if you are smart you will ignore it all. You already know what it is you should be doing and all you need now is the courage to get on with it. Start now, this very minute.|02-26-2015|pisces
443|Someone you live or work with will try to take liberties over the next 24 hours and although you are probably not that bothered you must not let them get away with it. If they can do it once they will try it on again and again.|02-27-2015|pisces
444|You can accomplish something remarkable this weekend but you need to be focused and you need to devote every moment to the task at hand. Ask yourself: do you have the desire and the staying power to see it through to the end?|02-28-2015|pisces
445|The full moon in your opposite sign of Virgo on Thursday will bring a partnership matter to a head. The good news is it won’t be as bitter as you thought it might. You have both made mistakes, so admit them and move on. |03-01-2015|pisces
446|You need to reveal more of your feelings. One of the reason others don’t know how to take you is because you have been wearing your deadpan face for so long they fear it might now be for real. It’s not, so get rid of it. |03-02-2015|pisces
447|You know what you want and you know how to get it and anyone who stands in your way won’t be standing for long. You may be gentle by nature but every now and again you go right the other way and just take what you desire.|03-03-2015|pisces
448|If you don’t like the way those around you are doing things then you must speak up about it, especially if you fear their mistakes could cost you money. And if they won’t listen? Then maybe it is time to say goodbye.|03-04-2015|pisces
449|Yes, of course, you have big plans, but have you thought them through properly? Today’s full moon in your opposite sign suggests you may have missed something of importance. A second opinion from someone you trust would be a good idea.|03-05-2015|pisces
450|If you want to make changes then now is the time. No matter how laid back a Pisces you happen to be today’s Sun-Pluto link will spur you into action and you will get so many things done. If only you could be this dynamic every day!|03-06-2015|pisces
451|You will be remarkably easygoing this weekend: no matter how badly other people may behave you won’t hold it against them. Either you are a saint or you are too caught up in your own dream world to care – most likely the latter!|03-07-2015|pisces
452|You need to find ways to improve your finances and with Mars so active in the money area of your chart over the next few days you won’t lack for ideas. Just be careful you choose the right ones. This is not a good time to gamble.|03-08-2015|pisces
453|What you own and what you earn is on your mind constantly at the moment but don’t worry yourself sick about it. There are more important things in life than dollars and cents, so keep a sense of perspective and find reasons to smile. |03-09-2015|pisces
454|Do you have what it takes to succeed? Of course you do. You may be a Pisces, one of the nicest signs in the zodiac, but that does not mean you cannot be ambitious too. If a promotion offer comes your way today you must take it.|03-10-2015|pisces
455|You don’t lack for courage at the moment but the planets warn you could easily stray over the line into recklessness. They also warn that friends and finances won’t go well together over the next 24 hours, so keep them well apart.|03-11-2015|pisces
456|Try not to get too hung-up on your long-term career plans. Yes, of course, you can and you must keep moving in your favored direction but there is no need to be so rigid about it. There is more than one route open to you now.|03-12-2015|pisces
457|Mind planet Mercury movies into your sign today, making it so much easier to decide what it is you want and what you are willing to do to get it. Never doubt that your desires are valid – and never stop looking for ways to meet them.|03-13-2015|pisces
458|Try not to take anything too seriously this weekend because the planets warn if you focus your mind too rigidly in one direction you could miss out on something more enjoyable that is happening in a different direction. Think lucky and you will be lucky.|03-14-2015|pisces
459|You will be a lot more assertive than usual over the next few days, most likely because you can sense that time is running out and you need to make your play quickly. That may be true but don’t forget that quality counts for more than quantity. |03-15-2015|pisces
460|Don’t cut corners and hope no one notices, because they will. You may be slipping behind and need to catch up but there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. The approaching eclipse will give you that extra surge of energy you need. |03-16-2015|pisces
461|Put financial considerations first today, especially if you are the kind of Pisces who usually does not have a clue how much is coming in and how much is going out. Cut back on unnecessary spending now or suffer later on.|03-17-2015|pisces
462|Avoid taking any kind of gamble today, especially with money, because Mercury linked to Neptune in your sign means there is no telling how it will work out – you could be a big winner or you could be an equally big loser. Why risk it?|03-18-2015|pisces
463|Tomorrow’s eclipse in your sign means that now is the time to go for glory. No matter how many times you have tried and failed before you WILL succeed now, so be positive and believe, really believe, that you are about to make the big time. |03-19-2015|pisces
464|It’s time to get serious about your dreams and ambitions. Look at the plans you have made in recent weeks and ask yourself if you are aiming too high or aiming too low. Most likely it’s the latter. Raise your sights and your game will follow. |03-20-2015|pisces
465|You need to question your priorities, especially those to do with your career and your money situation. You will get the chance to change things over the next few weeks but there is no point changing anything until you know what you really want. |03-21-2015|pisces
466|With Mercury in your sign linked to power planet Pluto you will think fast and act decisively over the next 24 hours. It would be great if you could be this dynamic every day but you can’t so make the most of it now. |03-22-2015|pisces
467|The universe wants you to throw caution to the wind and do something that takes everyone by surprise. Sometimes you can seem so laidback that others doubt you will ever be dynamic enough to succeed – but you’re about to prove them wrong. |03-23-2015|pisces
468|This is a good day to get out and about, to see and be seen. If you make new friends over the next 24 hours – and you surely will – they may well become friends for life, because you have so much in common.|03-24-2015|pisces
469|You will reach an important decision concerning your career over the next 24 hours and although not everyone will agree with the route you choose you know it is the right one for you. Take what it is you want from life. |03-25-2015|pisces
470|You will find it much easier now to express yourself and others will find it easier to understand what you are trying to say. Your difficulties stem entirely from poor communications, but as from today the words will start to flow again.|03-26-2015|pisces
471|You will find it difficult to make up your mind about something today but that may actually be a good thing. According to the planets it will pay you to put off making a decision about a work or money matter until early next week.|03-27-2015|pisces
472|Jupiter, planet of good fortune, is undergoing one of its retrograde phases, which means you cannot take your luck for granted. Enjoy what happens over the next 48 hours but make plans for when times are not so good as well.|03-28-2015|pisces
473|Try not to be so secretive about your feelings. According to the planets a certain person is as attracted to you as you are to them but, like you, they are not sure how to break the ice. Find out what lights their fire – and give it a try. |03-29-2015|pisces
474|It does not matter that you have made some kind of mistake, what matters is that you learn from it. Don’t be too stubborn to admit that you got it wrong, it’s no big deal. You are human like everyone else and mistakes are an integral part of life on this planet. |03-30-2015|pisces
475|Mars in the communications area of your chart makes it easy to say the kind of things that get you noticed, but don’t say too much or you might attract the kind of attention you don’t enjoy. Do you really want everyone to know your secrets? |03-31-2015|pisces
476|Time is moving on and the world is moving with it – so why are you standing still? Your attachment to the past is understandable but the best way to enjoy happiness and success is to earn them anew each and every day.|04-01-2015|pisces
477|If you are finding it hard to make up your mind about something then don’t force it. Others may be pushing you to make a quick decision but only because it benefits them in some way. Your inner voice is telling you to wait.|04-02-2015|pisces
478|Make sure your ego needs come first over the next 24 hours. You may be the type who worries more about other people than you do about yourself but you have needs and desires like everyone else. Make sure they are satisfied.|04-03-2015|pisces
479|If you make life difficult for someone this weekend they will go out of their way to make life difficult for you later on and, on balance, you will fare worse. You won’t get anywhere by being aggressive. Try working as a team.|04-04-2015|pisces
480|A commitment you made recently now doesn’t seem such a good idea and you may be wondering how to get out of it. Don’t worry, Monday’s Sun-Uranus link will throw everything up in the air again and provide you with a get-out clause. |04-05-2015|pisces
481|You don’t have to ask permission to make the changes you need but you do have to accept that not everyone will be happy with them. Also, the planets warn that the changes you make will be irreversible, so think before you act.|04-06-2015|pisces
482|Little things will rub you up the wrong way in a big way over the next 24 hours. Others may say you are overreacting, and maybe you are, but you are also right to get annoyed. It is the little things that mean the most.|04-07-2015|pisces
483|Some people say you should speak softly and carry a big stick but why do you need a stick when you know you can charm anyone you please? Your way with words is all the protection you need. There is magic in your voice.|04-08-2015|pisces
484|Start something new today, something that will make you popular and make you some serious money. But don’t get impatient. This is a long-term project and it will take time to grow. Think long-term. Think of it as an investment.|04-09-2015|pisces
485|Your viewpoint on an important issue will change dramatically over the next 48 hours – you may even end up at the opposite end of the opinion spectrum to where you are now. But that’s okay, you are allowed to change your mind. |04-10-2015|pisces
486|Aim to spend as much time as possible with loved ones over the next 48 hours. Remember too that no one is more important than those with whom you share a family bond. Your fates are entwined, so do what it takes to make it work.|04-11-2015|pisces
487|Partners and relatives will be extremely demanding over the next few days – and you won’t mind one bit. You like to feel needed and the kind of problems they come to you with will be the sort you know how to handle.|04-12-2015|pisces
488|What those around you say is going on may not be what is really going on, so use your Pisces powers of perception to find out what the true story is. Are they trying to keep things from you? Yes, most likely they are. |04-13-2015|pisces
489|If you need to say sorry for something you did earlier in the month then say it now. Venus in the domestic area of your chart means others will happily forgive and forget, but only if you are prepared to make the first move.|04-15-2015|pisces
490|Let someone you respect and admire know how much they mean to you. You have benefited a lot from their advice and assistance in recent weeks and it is only right that you acknowledge that fact. Buy them lunch, or even dinner.|04-17-2015|pisces
491|Try to avoid extremes this weekend because if you get carried away you could end up out of pocket financially and maybe out of favor with employers and other important people. Have fun by all means but watch what you say and do. |04-18-2015|pisces
492|The most important thing now is that you make a decision and stick to it, even if you have doubts about it later on. It does not actually matter if it is right or wrong, it matters only that you are consistent in your actions. |04-19-2015|pisces
493|The time has come to forgive and forget. The Sun moves on today and so must you – there is simply no point hanging on to disputes that belong in the past. It’s not about yesterday any more – all that matters is today and tomorrow.|04-20-2015|pisces
494|You will be confronted with a very tough challenge today and you will deal with it with ease. That might surprise those people who have only ever seen the softer side of your nature but there is a core of steel running through the Pisces personality.|04-21-2015|pisces
495|Make sure your opinions are heard over the next 24 hours, because if you don’t speak up you could find that matters you have an interest in move in a direction you don’t want them to go. Don’t be shy – shout if you have to.|04-22-2015|pisces
496|You don’t need to pound rivals into submission, not when your way with words is such that you can sweet talk them into doing whatever it is you desire. Whether your words are sincere is another matter entirely, of course.|04-23-2015|pisces
497|You have been far too nice of late, so now you need to even things up and make sure you get what you desire, regardless of whether others think you should have it. You are in control now, so make sure you are the one who wins.|04-24-2015|pisces
498|You need to be absolutely sure that you won’t be out of pocket if you go along with what friends are planning this weekend. You will happily give up your time but if cash is involved you can and you must give it a miss. |04-25-2015|pisces
499|Someone who is older and wiser will give you some good advice this week and if you are smart you will listen and learn. There are certain mistakes you don’t have to make – and won’t make if you choose to not let your ego get in the way. |04-26-2015|pisces
500|Try not to let your imagination get the better of you today, because once it heads off in a crazy direction it may be hard to bring it back to reality. The next few days are about keeping your feet on the ground, not your head in the air.|04-27-2015|pisces
501|Deals and negotiations of all kinds will go well today – you know just when to act tough and just when to make concessions. If you listen to that small voice inside your head there is no way you won’t come out a winner.|04-28-2015|pisces
502|Travel and social activities are under excellent stars right now, so don’t sit at home thinking about what amazing things might be going on some place else – get up and get out and find out for yourself. Move fast, mentally and physically.|04-29-2015|pisces
503|If you have something important to say you are advised to keep it short and sweet. The people you have to deal with, especially at work, are easily bored and will lose interest quickly if you spin things out too long. Get to the point.|04-30-2015|pisces
504|A needy individual may get on your nerves but being the nice guy you are you will do what you can to help them. But make sure they know that this is not going to become a regular thing. Sooner or later they have to get a grip.|05-01-2015|pisces
505|Where both family and career issues are concerned it might be wise to bend a little this weekend. Others may be rather demanding but if you help them out now they will assist later on when the roles are reversed. Invest in goodwill. |05-02-2015|pisces
506|Decide what needs to be done, then get on and do it. Some people may say you are moving too fast and taking too many risks, and maybe you are, but what fun would life be without stepping into the unknown occasionally? |05-03-2015|pisces
507|You have far too much going on in your life and today’s full moon will in some way or other shake things up and make you realize you need to cut back on your commitments. It should always be about quality, not quantity. |05-04-2015|pisces
508|Your mind may be full of big ideas right now but you must keep your feet on the ground. Most importantly, don’t commit yourself to any new plans or projects unless you know you will have the time to do them justice.|05-05-2015|pisces
509|You may think that if you don’t act fast someone else will beat you to a prize that should have been yours – and maybe you’re right, maybe they will – but is it really so important? You don’t have to be this competitive.|05-06-2015|pisces
510|Someone new on your social scene will get your heart beating faster today. Could a new romance be forming? Maybe, maybe not, but there is certainly a psychic link between you, a karmic connection that neither can ignore.|05-07-2015|pisces
511|Why are you worrying so much? Whatever the reason – assuming there is a reason – you need to get over it because there is so much you could be doing with your life now. And remember, even negative events can have positive results.|05-08-2015|pisces
512|It does not matter how much you give some people they still want more. Maybe you should take the hint and finally accept that this one-way street of you giving and them taking cannot go on. Cut the knot that binds you this weekend. |05-09-2015|pisces
513|Try not to get too possessive over something that is not really yours to own. You should know by now that the more you try to hold on to possessions the more likely they are to slip from your grasp, so hold it gently. |05-10-2015|pisces
514|Others may not agree with what you intend to do today but that won’t worry you in the slightest. Too often lately you have allowed others to control your behavior because you did not want to rock the boat. Now give it a really good shake! |05-11-2015|pisces
515|Too often in the past you have tried to mold yourself to fit other people’s expectations of you and sometimes the results have been less than pleasing. Be yourself today, and every day – it’s the only sure way to be happy.|05-12-2015|pisces
516|You will make more progress between now and the Sun’s change of signs on the 21st if you keep to the middle path and avoid extremes. The more others say you must take sides the more you should strive not to commit yourself.|05-13-2015|pisces
517|You seem to have a lot to say for yourself at the moment, which is fine, but if you talk too loud and too fast you may miss something worth hearing, something that could both have made you money and saved you trouble.|05-14-2015|pisces
518|You will get through so much work today that some people may wonder aloud if you are on some kind of stimulant! You’re not, of course, but you are certainly in one of those moods when you feel almost superhuman. Up, up and away!|05-15-2015|pisces
519|You may want to get a task out of the way quickly this weekend but the planets warn it is going to take longer than you expected. Don’t cut corners or leave it half-finished, get on with it and don’t stop until it is done, and done well.|05-16-2015|pisces
520|If you have something to say then say it now as the approaching new moon endows you with persuasive powers and even your most doubtful critic will be compelled to believe you. It will be even better if what you say is true! |05-17-2015|pisces
521|There is no point trying to focus on everyday chores because there are so many great things going on around you that your attention is sure to wander. Save the routine stuff for another day – now is the time to have some fun. |05-18-2015|pisces
522|You may have nothing to hide but that does not give friends and family members the right to probe into your private affairs. Anyone who tries to do so today must be told in no uncertain terms to mind their own business.|05-19-2015|pisces
523|Whatever new chores and duties come your way over the next few days – and there will be plenty – you can still have fun. Loved ones will go out of their way to make life enjoyable for you. Go out of your way to thank them.|05-20-2015|pisces
524|The Sun’s move into the domestic area of your chart today means you need to devote more time to your family. Whatever your duties in other directions your main responsibility now is to those who depend on you the most.|05-21-2015|pisces
525|You may be able to do a particular task better than just about anyone but that does not mean you should do it. You have more than enough on the go as it is at the moment, so don’t add to your load. Colleagues must share the burden.|05-22-2015|pisces
526|It may seem as if someone is as dissimilar to you as chalk is to cheese but over the next two days you will learn you have a lot in common. Superficially you are hugely different but on a deeper level you think and feel as one.|05-23-2015|pisces
527|If your conscience tells you that a certain course of action is wrong then you should give it a miss. If you push ahead regardless there will come a time towards the end of the week when you bitterly regret it. Listen to your inner voice.|05-24-2015|pisces
528|You seem to be in a friendly and forgiving mood at the moment, which is good, but there is a danger you could get friendly with someone you need to be wary of. Mercury retrograde warns you must look out for your own interests first.|05-25-2015|pisces
529|Don’t push yourself too hard over the next 24 hours. If you can get away with it today you should knock off early from work and give both your brain and your body a rest. Your batteries are desperately in need of a recharge. |05-26-2015|pisces
