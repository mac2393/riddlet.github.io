0|Think seriously about starting something new this week, something different to what you are used to. Tuesday’s new moon will inspire you to make the kind of courageous choices most people prefer to avoid. But you’re not most people!|12-01-2013|sagittarius
1|If you ask for something today you will most likely get it. But will it be good for you? The planets warn it might be smart to stick with what you already have and try to make the best of it. More is not necessarily better.|12-02-2013|sagittarius
2|As the new moon takes place in your birth sign it is essential that you choose one aim and stick with it. This can be and should be one of the most successful times of the year but don’t scatter your energies in a dozen directions.|12-03-2013|sagittarius
3|If a tough decision is called for then you must make it and live with the consequences. The planets warn that the worst possible thing you can do right now is to hedge your bets – come down on one side of the fence or the other.|12-04-2013|sagittarius
4|If you are not doing so already you should be making big plans – no, make that huge plans. Cosmic activity in your birth sign indicates that the more things you start the more you will accomplish and the more fun you will have. |12-05-2013|sagittarius
5|You may not be the best in certain areas but in one particular field of endeavor you have no equals and that is what you should be focusing on now. Don’t try to be all things to all men, just be yourself – it’s more than enough.|12-06-2013|sagittarius
6|There is no point worrying about things over which you have no control. That applies to all areas of your life but particularly to friendships and social activities. What will be will be, so buy your ticket and enjoy the ride.|12-07-2013|sagittarius
7|Make an effort to avoid all thoughts and feelings of doom and gloom. The Sun in your sign links with your ruler Jupiter this week but the effect could be to exaggerate what’s wrong with the world. It’s still a wonderful place. |12-08-2013|sagittarius
8|Some of the people you have to deal with today will drag their feet and find excuses why they cannot deliver what you require. You can lose your temper if you want but why raise your blood pressure? It will all come right with time.|12-09-2013|sagittarius
9|Your mind may be bubbling with a dozen great ideas but if you try to follow them all you will get nowhere fast. Decide what is the one aim that means the most to you then put your heart and soul into it. One masterpiece at a time!|12-10-2013|sagittarius
10|Make the most of the Sun in your sign to show the world what you are capable of. It’s never too late to make an impression or to move up in the world but there are times when it is easier than others and this is one of them.|12-11-2013|sagittarius
11|Don’t take anything too seriously today because if you do you may get depressed and start wondering why you bother to make an effort. Everyone gets moods like this occasionally. Snap out of it by focusing on things that make you smile.|12-12-2013|sagittarius
12|Why is it that people are so demanding of you? Most likely it’s because they know you are too nice to say “no”. At some stage today you need to get tough and let certain people know they have to do more for themselves from now on.|12-13-2013|sagittarius
13|If you can meet others halfway and work together on things that are of mutual importance there is no limit to what you can achieve over the next few days. Remember: what you do for others you also do for yourself.|12-14-2013|sagittarius
14|It’s time to take stock of what certain partnerships and relationships mean to you – and if you realize they don’t mean that much then maybe it’s time to bring them to an end. You cannot allow anyone to hold you back.|12-15-2013|sagittarius
15|Teamwork is essential over the coming 12 months, even if – especially if – you are the sort of Sag who likes to go it alone. Co-operation was, is and always will be the key to success and that applies as much to personal affairs as it does to your career.|12-16-2013|sagittarius
16|A full moon on your birthday means you need to pay more attention to partnerships over the next 12 months. That does not mean you have to give in every time there is a dispute of some kind but life will be easier if you let the other person win occasionally.|12-17-2013|sagittarius
17|There will be a setback concerning a money matter or business deal and you won’t be happy about it. But is it worth getting worked up about? Life is full of uncertainties but very few mean much in the greater scheme of things.|12-18-2013|sagittarius
18|The Sun remains in your sign only until Saturday, so get busy and get as much done as you can between now and then. That does not mean you won’t be able to get things done after that but it may not be so easy as it is now.|12-19-2013|sagittarius
19|You appear to be having second thoughts about a plan that previously you thought was the key to success. Maybe you are right to hesitate but at some stage you are going to have to make a choice and stick with it. Stop dithering!|12-20-2013|sagittarius
20|As the Sun leaves your sign today the emphasis of your affairs will start changing too, most noticeably in the way you deal with money. You may not have worried too much about cash flow before but you certainly need to now.|12-21-2013|sagittarius
21|Looking back on the past few weeks you will be amazed how much time you wasted on things that don’t really matter. On the other hand you did have a great deal of fun, so there is no need to feel guilty. Fun is an essential part of life.|12-22-2013|sagittarius
22|You know what needs to be done and you know that you must do it now, before anything else, so why are you hesitating? Push any doubts you may have to the back of your mind. As always, there is nothing to fear but fear itself.|12-23-2013|sagittarius
23|Money matters must come first today and with Mercury joining the Sun in the main financial area of your chart you will get the chance to balance the books. Over the longer term, try not to waste your cash on things you don’t really need.|12-24-2013|sagittarius
24|Plenty of people seem to be giving you advice at the moment but if you are wise you will disregard every last word of it. Only you know what you need, so only you are qualified to give guidance. Do what your inner voice tells you.|12-25-2013|sagittarius
25|You may come into money over the next few days but it would be wrong to count on it to get you out of trouble. The only way you are going to improve your financial situation is to cut back on your commitments – starting today.|12-26-2013|sagittarius
26|Your ability to resist temptation will be limited today, if it exists at all. But that’s okay because you need to let yourself go and have fun in that all-or-nothing Sagittarius way of yours. If it bucks up your spirits then it has to be good.|12-27-2013|sagittarius
27|The cosmic picture is slowly but surely moving in your favor and what happens this weekend will convince you that your luck is on the turn. It could have turned earlier but your negative attitude held you back. Don’t let that happen again.|12-28-2013|sagittarius
28|Anything of a financial or business nature will go well for you over the next few days – which makes a change. On the other hand, don’t start counting your profits or winnings before you actually have them in hand. That’s asking for trouble.|12-29-2013|sagittarius
29|Money matters may be causing you sleepless nights but there is really little to worry about. The approaching new moon will show you a simple way out of your predicament but you may not see it if your mind is clouded with fear.|12-30-2013|sagittarius
30|You may be on a roll and you may think you can do no wrong, but do you really want to risk it? According to the planets, if you bet big today you could win big; but you could lose big, too, so think carefully before making your choice. |12-31-2013|sagittarius
31|Go with the flow and let events work themselves out as they will. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to family and financial issues where, if you worry, you will only make matters worse. Tomorrow will take care of itself.|01-01-2014|sagittarius
32|Others may say you are aiming too high but you know that you have to aim high to increase your chances of hitting a worthwhile target. Sagittarius is known as the sign of the Archer, so grab your bow and do some hunting today.|01-02-2014|sagittarius
33|Whatever you decide over the next two or three days will — in some way or other — have a major effect on your future, so think ahead and make sure you are embarking on a course that is right for you. Don’t listen to others, listen to yourself.|01-03-2014|sagittarius
34|It may appear as if you are losing something of value, but in fact you are making room for something that is worth even more. The planets urge you to think ahead and focus on where you will be both a year and five years from now.|01-04-2014|sagittarius
35|If you need to approach someone for help with a business matter do so immediately. The planets indicate that if you make your pitch this week you stand a very good chance of getting what you ask for, so long as it isn’t too outrageous.|01-05-2014|sagittarius
36|There may have been some confusion of late but you should find it easy to set the record straight today. If your remarks have been misquoted or taken out of context make sure everyone knows it. Shout about it if you have to.|01-06-2014|sagittarius
37|You can make a little go a long way today, emotionally as well as financially. The trick is to not give too much away, to keep a little something in reserve and keep others guessing as to what you intend to do with it. |01-07-2014|sagittarius
38|Most times your hunches are spot on but the planets warn your instincts are not to be trusted today, so take care. This is one of those occasions when you must stick rigidly to the facts – and even they should be double checked.|01-08-2014|sagittarius
39|Don’t stay indoors and hide yourself away – get out into the world and show everyone what star quality looks like. You were born to put on a show, to be larger than life, so why are you peeking out from behind the curtains?|01-09-2014|sagittarius
40|Be positive about what happens today. Look on the bright side and realize that negativity of any kind will only add to your problems. Most of the world’s population would give their right arm to be you, so life can’t be that bad.|01-10-2014|sagittarius
41||01-11-2014|sagittarius
42|Be careful who you criticize this week because the full moon warns you could offend someone who has the power to make things difficult for you. You may be right in what you say but they won’t care in the slightest about that.|01-12-2014|sagittarius
43|Something will happen over the next 24 hours that makes you feel a lot better about your long-term prospects. It will also make you realize that wealth, like so many other things in life, is as much a state of mind as anything else.|01-13-2014|sagittarius
44|You may spend too much over the next few days but if you spend it mainly on other people it won’t be so bad. You are a generous soul at heart and like to see friends and family enjoy themselves. Don’t bankrupt yourself though.|01-14-2014|sagittarius
45|Tomorrow’s full moon makes it likely that you will clash with someone over money and possessions. But don’t take the situation too seriously because in a matter of days neither of you will be able to remember what it was all about.|01-15-2014|sagittarius
46|Your words will carry more weight if you keep what you have to say short and to the point. Don’t bother with explanations or clarifications, just say what you mean and leave no one in any doubt that you mean what you say. Less means more.|01-16-2014|sagittarius
47|Someone you meet today will open your eyes to new possibilities. But that does not mean you should drop what you are doing and head off in a new direction. Wait for the Sun to change signs on Monday before making decisions.|01-17-2014|sagittarius
48|Try not to attach so much importance to material things. Try not to get hung up on the fact that more cash seems to be going out than is coming in. This is only a temporary phase and is already coming to an end, so cheer up.|01-18-2014|sagittarius
49|As from Monday, when the Sun changes signs, you will find it so much easier to let partners and loved ones know how you feel. In fact all you ever have to do is be open and honest about who you are and what it is you desire.|01-19-2014|sagittarius
50|The pace of life is going to hot up over the next few days and you will have a lot of fun seeing how fast and how far you can go. But don’t go so fast and so far that you risk having an accident. Pace yourself sensibly.|01-20-2014|sagittarius
51|Get out and about. Be sociable. Wherever you go and whatever you do you will have a lot of fun and even the most ordinary of encounters will be hugely enjoyable. Make the effort to talk to people – you may learn something worth knowing.|01-21-2014|sagittarius
52|Be honest. Let others know what they are doing is wrong and what they must do to put it right. Most importantly, don’t allow yourself to worry that you might bruise their sensitive egos. Honesty is the best policy even if it hurts.|01-22-2014|sagittarius
53|The only reason someone is being so critical is because they resent your success. Perhaps you should point out to them that if they worked as hard as you they might be successful too. On the other hand, why waste your breath?|01-23-2014|sagittarius
54|Don’t take it personally if a friend is overly critical. They are probably more annoyed with themselves than they are with you but their ego won’t let them admit it. It’s not worth fighting about. They’ll make it up to you tomorrow.|01-24-2014|sagittarius
55|It could be that you feel a bit worn down and discouraged. If so you need to get a grip on yourself because the planets warn if you give up on something now you will only have to start it again later. Dig deep and carry on.|01-25-2014|sagittarius
56|Let everyone around you, at home and at work, know what you think and how you feel and they will go out of their way to meet your needs and make you happy. Misunderstandings will only arise if you expect people to read your mind.|01-26-2014|sagittarius
57|Your main task over the next few days is to find ways to fulfill your obligations, both at home and at work, while still having fun socially. For best results, steer clear of extremes and steer clear of people who bring out the worst in you.|01-27-2014|sagittarius
58|The Sun in Aquarius makes you more outgoing and sociable than usual and that’s good because other aspects indicate that someone interesting is coming your way. Don’t look away and pretend you don’t see them – let them catch your eye.|01-28-2014|sagittarius
59|Why are you not getting what you want out of life? If you are honest, you will have to admit it is because you are spending too much time on things of minor importance. Devote yourself to making the most of your talents.|01-29-2014|sagittarius
60|You should be feeling a lot more relaxed about life now and today’s new moon will put you in the mood to go out and have fun with your friends. Partnerships and relationships will make you happier than you ever thought possible.|01-30-2014|sagittarius
61|You know what needs to be done to put things right and put loved ones and business colleagues at their ease – so do it. Just make sure you can deliver on any promises you might make – and never, ever make promises about money.|01-31-2014|sagittarius
62|You may be tempted to give up on something, or someone, that is causing you grief but the planets warn that would be a mistake. The situation will improve unexpectedly early next week, so stick with it. Since when have you been a quitter?|02-01-2014|sagittarius
63|You can turn dreams into realities this week – no, really. All you have to do is be yourself and believe in yourself. The latter is important as various people will try to convince you that you don’t stand a chance. They’re wrong.|02-03-2014|sagittarius
64|According to the planets someone you work or do business with is not being entirely straight with you. Before you go any further together in what you are working on demand to know where they are coming from – and going to.|02-04-2014|sagittarius
65|You need to talk through issues that have been making life difficult for you and your loved ones. Someone needs to take the lead, and according to the planets, that someone will have to be you. No one else is brave enough. |02-05-2014|sagittarius
66|Try not to let your impatience get the better of you today. With mind planet Mercury beginning one of its retrograde phases there is simply no point rushing to get things done. In the greater scheme of things they’re really not that important.|02-06-2014|sagittarius
67|Change is good, change is positive, so whatever else you do today don’t fight the changes that come your way. You were not designed by the cosmos to stay where you are – you were designed to explore and try out new things.|02-07-2014|sagittarius
68|You should find it easy to talk to partners and colleagues this weekend: You will be on just the right wavelength and know just the right things to say. Help loved ones and friends to feel good about themselves — and you’ll feel good too.|02-08-2014|sagittarius
69|Put feelings of regret and remorse behind you and act as if life has never been better. Even a livewire Sag gets a bit down now and again but you bounce back faster than most. Remember: what makes life worth living is loving and laughing.|02-10-2014|sagittarius
70|This should be an encouraging time for you as your money worries fade and your ability to enjoy the simple things in life returns. One sad person may try to bring you down with their tales of woe, but you don’t have to listen. |02-11-2014|sagittarius
71|Family ties must come first. Put petty arguments behind you and move forward together again. Cosmic activity in the domestic sector of your chart makes it easy to kiss and make up today – but from tomorrow it may be too late.|02-12-2014|sagittarius
72|You will get more done if you take a gentler approach to partnership matters. Put yourself in others’ shoes and imagine how you would feel if someone talked to you the way you sometimes talk to them. You can be a bit abrupt at times.|02-13-2014|sagittarius
73|If you do things for others that they should be doing for themselves it won’t be long before they expect you to do it all. You need to be tough today. You need to let others know that they need to take more responsibility for themselves.|02-14-2014|sagittarius
74|You have freedom to move in whatever direction takes your fancy, but don’t forget you also have responsibilities and that certain people are depending on you in various ways. Take them with you on your whirlwind journey. Brighten their weekend.|02-15-2014|sagittarius
75|The most important thing now is that you assert your independence. If you allow others to order you around they will get the impression that you are weak and will make your life a misery every chance they get. Don’t let that happen.|02-17-2014|sagittarius
76|Someone will surprise you today with what amounts to an outrageous ultimatum. Surprise them back by telling them in no uncertain language what they can do with their demands. Refuse to be intimidated. Eventually they will back down.|02-18-2014|sagittarius
77|You must control your temper today, no matter how extreme the provocation may be. That may be easier said than done, but it must be done or what starts as a minor dispute could quickly get out of hand. Avoid people who like to fight. |02-19-2014|sagittarius
78|As the Sun is now moving through the domestic area of your chart it will pay you to focus more on family members than on yourself or your work. What can you do to make them happy? How can you let them know they are loved?|02-20-2014|sagittarius
79|Either you will change your mind and annoy other people, or they will change their minds and annoy you. Either way tempers are going to be a bit on the short side over the next 24 hours. Try not to say anything too emotionally damaging.|02-21-2014|sagittarius
80|You may be reluctant to cross swords with a rival but at some stage you are going to have to face them. It’s better you should do so now, while the omens are good for a peaceful solution, than later when you’re both fired up for a fight.|02-22-2014|sagittarius
81|Loved ones and work colleagues will forgive you almost anything this week, so you may as well make the most of it. However, you will be forgiven just the once, so if you are going to get caught at least make sure the sin is worth it!|02-23-2014|sagittarius
82|Try to be more open with partners and loved ones as the new week begins. If you make the effort you will quite easily find the words that have been lacking these past few weeks – words that heal rifts that are no more than misunderstandings.|02-24-2014|sagittarius
83|If a loved one demands more independence you must give it to them. You should know by now that the harder you try to control other people the more it hurts when they finally break away. You’re their friend, not their jailer.|02-25-2014|sagittarius
84|If you need assistance then you must speak up. You have helped others out so many times in the past that they will go out of their way to help you in return, but they can’t do that unless they know you are hurting. Tell them.|02-26-2014|sagittarius
85|You don’t have to rely on other people. You are perfectly equipped to go it alone if that is what you desire. You have high hopes for the future and will make quicker progress if you don’t have to worry about dragging others along behind you.|02-27-2014|sagittarius
86|Now that Mercury, planet of communication, is moving in your favor again you will find it much easier to express yourself. But don’t let everyone know what is going on in that big brain of yours. Never forget that knowledge is power.|02-28-2014|sagittarius
87|Loved ones and relatives may have been difficult to handle in recent weeks but only because you were not approaching them in the right way. Now that you understand their fears a bit better you can find ways to get through to them.|03-01-2014|sagittarius
88|Hard work never hurt anyone, or so they say, but that does not mean you have to work yourself into the ground every minute of every day. This week’s influences will offer you the chance to take a well-earned break. Don’t be a fool and turn it down.|03-02-2014|sagittarius
89|Some things are more difficult than others but this will be one of those days when everything comes easy to you. With the Sun linked to Pluto, planet of power, there is nothing you cannot do. So ask yourself: what is it you WANT to do?|03-03-2014|sagittarius
90|The situation you have to deal with today is of a kind you would prefer to avoid, but once you get stuck into it you will find it provides the kind of challenges that require brain power to resolve – and that’s the kind you enjoy.|03-04-2014|sagittarius
91|You can get through twice as much work in half as much time as you usually do today, but don’t spend all your time on everyday chores because this is also an aspect that increases the fun factor of your life. You remember fun, don’t you?|03-05-2014|sagittarius
92|Some people seem to be under the impression that they can snap their fingers and you will come running but with Jupiter, your ruler, on great form today they are in for a rude awakening. If anyone is going to be imperious it is going to be you.|03-06-2014|sagittarius
93|Someone will offer what sounds like good advice today but the planets warn they are more likely to be thinking of their interests rather than yours. You don’t have to be told what to do. Listen to your inner voice – it knows what you need.|03-07-2014|sagittarius
94|You seem to be getting bogged down in trivia, so stand back from what you are doing and try to see it from a wider viewpoint. Once you realize how unimportant it all is you won’t feel in the least bit bad about ditching it.|03-08-2014|sagittarius
95|Don’t waste time worrying about the things that you have done or about the things that you still have to do. You are more likely to enjoy the week ahead if you take life as it comes and react to events rather than try to incite them.|03-09-2014|sagittarius
96|Doors that have been closed to you in the past will start to open over the next few days but for some reason you may decide not to walk through. Even if you cannot explain your reluctance listen to what your inner voice tells you.|03-10-2014|sagittarius
97|You are where you are for a reason, so don’t start complaining that you would rather be some place else. No matter what occurs over the next 24 hours, be it “good” or be it “bad”, you can be sure it will benefit you in the long-term.|03-11-2014|sagittarius
98|You have no doubts and no fears and no reason to believe you will not succeed at the tasks you have set yourself. Rivals on the work front may try to derail your plans over the next few days but they won’t come close to succeeding.|03-12-2014|sagittarius
99|Don’t waste time lamenting what might have been. Sagittarius is a Fire sign, which among other things means you should always be looking forward to the next big adventure. Yesterday is over and done with. It’s time to move on.|03-13-2014|sagittarius
100|You have so many options available to you now that it may be hard to know where to start. For best results you should spend as much time as possible in social situations. New people you meet will bring new career and romantic opportunities.|03-14-2014|sagittarius
101|Dealings with employers and other important people could be a bit touch and go over the next couple of days. Was it something you said? Remember, what sounds like a good joke to you could be taken as a personal insult by others.|03-15-2014|sagittarius
102|Before you agree to get involved in a project of some kind make sure you know what you are letting yourself in for. You need to be thinking along similar lines to your new partners and colleagues. If you’re not, give it a miss.|03-16-2014|sagittarius
103|Mercury, planet of communication, moves into the domestic area of your chart today, so an exchange of ideas, and feelings, with partners and loved ones will be of benefit to you all. The more you talk the more you will understand one another.|03-17-2014|sagittarius
104|If there is something you want to tell the world, something you think it should know, shout about it as loudly as you can. You’ve always had an outsize ego and now you have an outsize voice to go with it. Make sure you get heard.|03-18-2014|sagittarius
105|No matter how difficult the past few weeks have been your affairs will improve dramatically as from tomorrow, so cheer up and stop acting as if the world is about to come to an end. That kind of apocalyptic nonsense is beneath your intelligence.|03-19-2014|sagittarius
106|You don’t lack for confidence, do you? The Sun’s move into your fellow Fire sign of Aries endows you with the kind of self-belief that moves mountains. There is a world out there waiting to be impressed by your brilliance. Get to it!|03-20-2014|sagittarius
107|Refuse to lower your standards or do anything you consider to be underhand or unfair. Others may enjoy cutting corners and breaking rules but you know that in the long-term negative behaviour has a way of coming back at you.|03-21-2014|sagittarius
108|There is always something new to learn and Mercury, planet of the mind, will teach you something worth knowing over the next 48 hours. It will also remind you that the most important thing of all is to be at peace with yourself.|03-22-2014|sagittarius
109|Nothing much will trouble you this week and that’s a good thing because nothing much is worth getting worked up about. Recent events have reminded you that getting involved and choosing sides very often makes things worse than they were before.|03-23-2014|sagittarius
110|You will see someone you thought of as a rival in a new light today – they are in fact one of the best friends you’ve got. Like all best friends they may sometimes tell you things you don’t want to hear – but it’s for your own good.|03-24-2014|sagittarius
111|The planets warn that you may have to end friendships and associations that no longer meet your needs. Once you have done that there will be room in your life to start new ones with people whose views are more in line with your own.|03-25-2014|sagittarius
112|Today’s Mercury-Jupiter aspect will help you find the words to connect with those you are closest to. You don’t have to get emotional about it but you do have to remind them that your love was, is and always will be unconditional.|03-26-2014|sagittarius
113|It’s not like you to withdraw into your shell but you may do so over the next 24 hours. That’s okay. You have important issues to decide on and you won’t think straight if there is too much noise going on around you. Take some time out.|03-27-2014|sagittarius
114|You may be a rebel by nature but this is not a good time to rock the boat. Instead, find out what assistance friends and family members need and do what you can to help them realize their goals. In short, be positive rather than negative.|03-28-2014|sagittarius
115|A little charm will go a long way over the next 48 hours. Your way with words, your sense of humor and your winning smile will help persuade almost anyone to do almost anything for you. Does that get your thoughts racing? It should!|03-29-2014|sagittarius
116|It’s quite possible you will bite off more than you can chew this week, most likely around the time the Sun links with Jupiter, your ruler, on Tuesday. Now that you know that you can respect your own limits and stay within them, can’t you? |03-30-2014|sagittarius
117|There is something that needs to be done as a matter of urgency. The longer you leave it the more you will have to rush things when you do eventually get started and that could lead to mistakes. Draw up a “to do” list and stick to it.|03-31-2014|sagittarius
118|You may hear something about your money situation that brings a smile to your face today but don’t be too hasty. The planets warn there is a chance you are being misled, so don’t go on a spending spree on the strength of a promise.|04-01-2014|sagittarius
119|If you think you are being cheated on something you must speak up. It may be that you have got the wrong end of the stick and there is nothing amiss, but until you know that for sure you cannot afford to take chances.|04-02-2014|sagittarius
120|A new business venture can be a success but to make it work you will need to give everything to it. Is it worth the time and energy? Only you can decide and the planets indicate you will have to make that decision very soon.|04-03-2014|sagittarius
121|Don’t let people play on your feelings and get you to do things you might not choose to do if you were thinking logically. At some point you need to get tough and let them know you are no longer prepared to play this game.|04-04-2014|sagittarius
122|You will be unable to resist a cry for help this weekend, even though you are far from sure it is genuine. It’s not whether someone deserves your help that matters but that you are prepared to give it from the goodness of your heart.|04-05-2014|sagittarius
123|Raise your sights this week and believe that you can create something magnificent. Others may try to persuade you that you are aiming too high but that simply isn’t true. The universe indicates there are no limits, at least not for you.|04-06-2014|sagittarius
124|Don’t worry if you are not feeling on top of the world at the moment because with mind planet Mercury joining the Sun in the most dynamic area of your chart it’s just a matter of time before your mood improves. There, see, you’re smiling already.|04-07-2014|sagittarius
125|Try to get out and about today. The planets indicate that the more you are on the move the more likely it is you will meet new people and learn new things – and knowledge, as you are well aware, is the basis of real power.|04-08-2014|sagittarius
126|The more certain people say you have taken on too much the more determined you will be to prove them wrong. Sagittarius is the sort of sign that likes to do things in a big way – it’s in your nature to put on a show. Go for it.|04-09-2014|sagittarius
127|You have a tendency to say things you don’t really believe simply because you enjoy seeing the looks of shock on other people’s faces. It may be a lot of fun but it could backfire on you today. Try laughing with people, not just at them.|04-10-2014|sagittarius
128|You may be on top of your game at the moment but a week or so from now your energy may dip a bit, so don’t make too many plans and certainly don’t take on any more chores. If anything you need a rest, not more work.|04-11-2014|sagittarius
129|If you make a mistake this weekend – and according to the planets you most likely will – no harm will come of it so long as you remedy the situation as quickly as possible. If you have to say “sorry” make sure your apology sounds genuine.|04-12-2014|sagittarius
130|If others want to fight over petty differences then let them – it has nothing to do with you. Make the most of the Sun’s last few days in the most dynamic area of your chart to bring a creative project to a successful conclusion.|04-13-2014|sagittarius
131|There will be times over the next two or three days when you seem out of your depth but that is not an excuse to give up. If you do you will most likely regret it as the planets bring new self-belief and new opportunities.|04-14-2014|sagittarius
132|Don’t think too hard about something that appears wholly illogical – it will only scramble your brains even more than they are scrambled already! A number of strange, even bizarre, things are likely to happen but none of them can do you harm.|04-15-2014|sagittarius
133|You can succeed and you will succeed but you will succeed a lot quicker if you get help from people who share your ambitions. Teamwork is the way to move forward and that, of course, means compromise. You know you can do it!|04-16-2014|sagittarius
134|If you own up to some sort of transgression today it may surprise you how little others seem to care about it. Either it’s not such a big deal after all or their own sins are many times worse. Either way, for you it’s a win.|04-17-2014|sagittarius
135|Stand back from your everyday cares and see life from a wider perspective. It may be easy to believe that the odds are stacked against you, that nothing will ever go right again, but that’s an illusion brought about by too narrow a focus.|04-18-2014|sagittarius
136|Wave goodbye to wishful thinking and focus on the realities of your present situation. That does not mean your dreams should be abandoned but you do need to get serious about which of them have potential and which are just pie in the sky.|04-19-2014|sagittarius
137|You may be asked to take on more chores and responsibilities now that the Sun is moving through the area of your chart that governs your everyday workload. By all means do what you can but don’t try to do everything – you’re not Superman.|04-20-2014|sagittarius
138|You are entitled to your opinions but you are not entitled to expect that other people will agree with you. So long as you’re okay with that nothing much will go wrong but if you cannot accept alternative viewpoints it could be a difficult day.|04-21-2014|sagittarius
139|There may be an element of risk in what you are planning but you know if you don’t go ahead with it you will hate yourself for being so timid. Prepare as well as you can then jump right in and pray it goes according to plan!|04-22-2014|sagittarius
140|While everyone else is running around and bumping into each other as if the end of the world is nigh you will be the picture of tranquility. That may mean you actually have no idea what is going on but there are times when ignorance is no bad thing.|04-23-2014|sagittarius
141|The cosmic picture is so good at the moment that most people will respond positively if you approach them the right way – as equals and partners. On the work front especially if you smile and ask nicely you’ll get everything you need.|04-24-2014|sagittarius
142|If you have been too busy to spend much quality time with loved ones recently you will get the chance to make up for it over the next few days. You’ve had your fun, now you want those you have feelings for to have fun as well.|04-25-2014|sagittarius
143|A job worth doing is a job worth doing well, so knuckle down and make sure no one has any reason to question the quality of the finished product. Whether you work with your head or your hands you’ll make a huge impression this weekend.|04-26-2014|sagittarius
144|Limit yourself to one or two major tasks rather than the half dozen or so you were planning. Quality is always more important than quantity, so be selective and let others see you take pride in what you do – then they’ll pay you more for it.|04-27-2014|sagittarius
145|Because you like to be independent you may not enjoy what takes place over the next 24 hours. You may have to fight for your right to set your own agenda and come and go as you please, but it’s a fight worth having – and winning.|04-28-2014|sagittarius
146|You may find it hard to be patient today but stay in control and don’t let your temper get the better of you. The planets warn if you get annoyed you could do yourself harm. At this time of year your health is especially important.|04-29-2014|sagittarius
147|Don’t worry too much if you get behind in your work because there will be plenty of time to catch up later on. It would help, of course, if you were not so willing to take on other people’s tasks. You can be too generous you know.|04-30-2014|sagittarius
148|Try to say only nice things about friends and colleagues, because if you make your true feelings known it will cause you all sorts of problems. That applies doubly on the work front, no matter how much you may despise certain people.|05-01-2014|sagittarius
149|You will no doubt be annoyed if something holds you back today but later on you will thank your lucky stars that you were forced to stay where you are. If fate conspires to keep you from doing something there must be a reason.|05-02-2014|sagittarius
150|Cosmic activity in the work and wellbeing area of your chart will make the next few days interesting to say the least. But don’t think you have to change things to keep up with the times. As of now the times can keep up with you.|05-03-2014|sagittarius
151|You will get an opportunity to put your point of view a crossover the next few days, so know what it is you want to say then say it with total self confidence. It would help, of course, if your point of view is right as well.|05-04-2014|sagittarius
152|It’s not like you to put practical matters above having fun but you may have no choice in the matter over the next 24 hours. Social activities will have to take second place to getting on top of your work and money situations – for now.|05-05-2014|sagittarius
153|If others won’t give you what you deserve then you will just have to take it for yourself. You have worked long and hard to reach your current position and have no intention of letting others take the glory, or the money.|05-06-2014|sagittarius
154|Life is not a zero sum game – other people don’t have to lose out just so that you can win. Your task today is to find creative ways in which to further your own ambitions while helping others to get what they need as well.|05-07-2014|sagittarius
155|Don’t think badly of yourself if you have to admit that you have failed to reach a target of some sort. The fact is you tried – when so many other people never even get started – and that alone makes you some kind of hero.|05-08-2014|sagittarius
156|You will be caught out by something you did not expect today. The simple fact is you have taken certain things for granted when you had no reason to do so. Admit you made a mistake and do what you can to put it right.|05-09-2014|sagittarius
157|It is essential that you strive to get along with friends and co-workers this weekend because that is the only way you are going to get anything done. Also, if someone goes out of their way to annoy you just ignore them. It’s a test.|05-10-2014|sagittarius
158|You will get support from some unlikely sources over the next few days. People will rally round and make life easier for you. You will get the chance to repay their generosity over the next few weeks go out of your way to do so.|05-11-2014|sagittarius
159|Try not to come on too strong when debating with other people. You may have all the best opinions and the facts and figures are certainly on your side but make allowances for those who don’t share your passion for the truth.|05-12-2014|sagittarius
160|If you need to make changes in your working environment now is the time. The approaching full moon warns that some of your colleagues won’t like what you do but that’s too bad. Either they fit in with your plans or they move out.|05-13-2014|sagittarius
161|You are who you are for a reason, so don’t let anyone get away with telling you that you should think or act in ways that don’t feel right to you. Fortunately, there is something obstinate in your nature that refuses to compromise.|05-14-2014|sagittarius
162|You seem a lot more relaxed about life in general and affairs of the heart in particular now and that’s good. You also seem a lot less concerned with what other people think about what you are doing. If it feels right to you, carry on!|05-15-2014|sagittarius
163|You need to make some kind of change to your everyday routine and you need to make it immediately. Astrology is all about time and timing and the time to get started is now, while both your motivation and energy are high.|05-16-2014|sagittarius
164|Others will happily heap more work on your shoulders this weekend, but only because they know you won’t complain. Maybe it’s time to get tough and let them know that, starting right now, you will work for no-one but yourself.|05-17-2014|sagittarius
165|Try not to be too assertive or aggressive. With the Sun moving into your opposite sign this week the best way to get things done – and maybe the only way – is to cooperate with like-minded people. The rewards are big enough to share around.|05-18-2014|sagittarius
166|The more others sing your praises today the more suspicious you should be. Don’t be taken in by their sweet talk. The fact is they are after something you possess and will say anything to get you to part with it. You’re not that stupid, are you?|05-19-2014|sagittarius
167|It’s good that you support some kind of cause but don’t fall into the trap of believing that it’s okay to use underhand methods to further your aims. Despite what some fools say the ends do not justify the means, not now, not ever.|05-20-2014|sagittarius
168|Find ways to get along with people who rub you up the wrong way. Like it or not you are going to have to work closely with various individuals over the next few weeks, so forget about your differences. Focus on what you have in common.|05-21-2014|sagittarius
169|You have been asking some searching questions of yourself of late and today you will discover that the answers you seek are not to be found in your career or in making more money. Listen to your inner voice. It knows what you need.|05-22-2014|sagittarius
170|Now that the Sun has moved into the partnership area of your chart you will have to take what other people think and see and need into account more than you usually do. Together you can do great things but your aims must be compatible.|05-23-2014|sagittarius
171|Why have you let your fears get the better of you? There is no logical reason why you should be so afraid – none whatsoever – so realize that your fears are all in the mind then cleanse your mind of any and all negative thoughts. Do it now.|05-24-2014|sagittarius
172|Partners and colleagues and loved ones will do almost anything for you over the next few days – all you have to do is ask. Don’t worry that you may be wasting their time because they don’t see it that way. They want to be nice to you.|05-25-2014|sagittarius
173|The most important thing over the next few days is that you don’t give anyone the authority to make decisions on your behalf. The message of the stars is that you must stay in control of your destiny – because everything else depends on that.|05-26-2014|sagittarius
174|Anything of a one-to-one nature, be it personal, professional or financial, can be changed for the better over the next few days. Romance is especially well starred and one special person will make it feel as if all your birthdays have come at once.|05-27-2014|sagittarius
175|It may be that your rivals have the advantage but what happens today and tomorrow will give you the courage, as well as the opportunity, to turn the tables on them. Believe you will win. The more confident you look the better you will do.|05-28-2014|sagittarius
176|You may have lots of tasks to complete but now is not the time to get busy on them. As Venus, planet of harmony, moves into the wellbeing area of your chart today your best course of action is to take life easy and let good things happen.|05-29-2014|sagittarius
177|By all means stand up for what you believe but don’t turn it into a war. Just because some people disagree with you does not mean you have to beat them into submission. It takes all sorts to make such an interesting world.|05-30-2014|sagittarius
178|The world seems a sunnier and happier place now and with the Sun and Mars on your side this weekend just about everything will go right for you. Relationships and friendships are under excellent stars, so get out there and socialize.|05-31-2014|sagittarius
179|Cooperation is the key to success. If you go it alone this week you won’t much enjoy where you end up – if, indeed, you end up anywhere at all. The more you work with other people the more all of you will gain. It’s win-win!|06-01-2014|sagittarius
180|If there is something you want to sort out with a loved one then you need to be quick about it. Mercury, planet of communication, turns retrograde on the 7th, making it much harder to make a friendly connection. So speak up now.|06-02-2014|sagittarius
181|It is important that you keep the momentum going today because if you slow down even a little bit your energy could tail off dramatically. Also, don’t attach too much importance to a relationship problem. It’s not as bad as it seems.|06-03-2014|sagittarius
182|You may have certain duties to fulfill but that does not mean you have to do everything others expect of you. Make sure everyone knows that you answer to one boss only and that’s the person you see in the mirror each morning!|06-04-2014|sagittarius
183|Things may get a bit bumpy over the next day or two but if you sit tight the turbulence will pass. If others want to throw tantrums and look silly that’s up to them – you are under no obligation to follow their example.|06-05-2014|sagittarius
184|You should be making great progress now and if you are not it can only be a matter of time. Make an effort to move up in the world and make sure others can see that you are going places. Everyone loves a winner. Everyone loves you.|06-06-2014|sagittarius
185|What seems such a trivial issue to you is of major importance to someone else, so make allowances. If you want some peace today it might be wise to make it look as if you share their concerns – even if you really could not care less.|06-07-2014|sagittarius
186|Your grasp of the facts will leave something to be desired over the next few days, so steer clear of situations where you are expected to make decisions that other people are going to rely on. They won’t be happy if you get it wrong.|06-08-2014|sagittarius
187|Little things will annoy you more than big things today and the more you tell yourself to stop being silly the more annoyed you will get. By this time tomorrow you will have calmed down but today you’ll need all your powers of self-control.|06-09-2014|sagittarius
188|Something will occur over the next 48 hours that reminds you just how much there still is to learn. You may yearn for perfection but the simple fact is it’s never going to happen, so learn to be happy with who you are.|06-10-2014|sagittarius
189|Even a Sagittarius gets it wrong now and again so don’t take it to heart if you have made some kind of mistake. And don’t try to cover it up either. You are always bold in your successes, so be bold in your failures too!|06-11-2014|sagittarius
190|A lot of good things have been happening of late but tomorrow’s full moon in your sign will confront you with an issue that is unlikely to have a happy ending. Decide what is best for you personally, and for those you love, then act accordingly.|06-12-2014|sagittarius
191|The full moon in your sign could see you acting out of character today and you may even make a bit of a fool of yourself. But what does it matter? It’s all good, clean fun and no one will think any the less of you for it.|06-13-2014|sagittarius
192|Make sure others know who is in charge over the next 48 hours. You may not want to get heavy about it but certain people have been taking liberties and it has to stop. Make an example of one individual and everyone will get the message.|06-14-2014|sagittarius
193|If your conscience is nagging at you to own up to something then now is the time to admit your guilt. You may be surprised how little others actually care. It’s all about timing and now is the best time to be honest.|06-15-2014|sagittarius
194|You may be tempted to bring a partnership of some kind to a close but don’t be too hasty. The planets indicate there is life in it yet, so hang in there and find ways to make it work. Chances are you’ll be glad you did.|06-16-2014|sagittarius
195|Your self-confidence could take a bit of a dive today, even though your circumstances have not changed at all. Everyone goes through a down phase once in a while, so don’t attach too much importance to it. You’ll come up smiling, as always.|06-17-2014|sagittarius
196|The best way to avoid an unpleasant situation is to pretend it does not exist. You are not in the mood for confrontation and there is no cosmic law that says you have to face situations, or people, you would prefer to avoid. Be invisible.|06-18-2014|sagittarius
197|It is important that you deal with an outstanding feud immediately because if you allow it to linger it will hold you back later and that could be disastrous. Look a bit harder for a compromise solution – it won’t be difficult to find.|06-19-2014|sagittarius
198|The most important thing now is that you do not allow vague fears and forebodings to hold you back from what you are planning. Yes, there are a number of things that can go wrong but even if they do the consequences won’t be so bad.|06-20-2014|sagittarius
199|Anything to do with your wealth – property and investments in particular – must be handled with care over the next few weeks. There is a lot to be won but also a lot to be lost, so think before you act and never let others take decisions for you.|06-21-2014|sagittarius
200|It would appear that someone or something has affected you deeply and you are struggling hard to keep your emotions in check. But why? Everyone has feelings, even a Sagittarius, and it’s not healthy to keep them locked up inside.|06-22-2014|sagittarius
201|Everyone seems to be singing your praises now but your number one priority should be helping someone else feel special. It seems that a loved one is feeling a bit neglected, so go out of your way to spend time with them.|06-23-2014|sagittarius
202|You will get things done quicker today if you join forces with people who share your aims, ambitions, principles and beliefs. Also, tell the most special person in your life how much you adore them. They may need some reassurance.|06-24-2014|sagittarius
203|You may have to twist a few arms to get what you want today but it won’t be too difficult, in fact you will enjoy playing the tough guy. Just make sure you only make life tough for your rivals and enemies – not your friends.|06-25-2014|sagittarius
204|Use your energy wisely today because if you waste it on trivial things you could pay dearly for it tomorrow. Don’t listen to what others say is important, listen only to what your own inner voice tells you is important.|06-26-2014|sagittarius
205|Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart may give you a rather negative view of life but it does not have to be that way. What happens over the next 24 hours will confirm that you are loved and admired.|06-27-2014|sagittarius
206|It does not matter if other people approve of your aims – the only thing that matters is they mean something to you. Get on with your planning, then get on with doing what has to be done. You don’t need anyone’s permission to be yourself.|06-28-2014|sagittarius
207|News that comes your way over the next few days may not be entirely to your liking but it is certainly what you need. Look on the bright side and look for ways you can turn events around so they work in your favor.|06-29-2014|sagittarius
208|There are times when it is sensible to let other people take the lead and this is most certainly one of them. As from tomorrow, when Mercury moves in your favor again, you can seize the initiative and make things happen.|06-30-2014|sagittarius
209|It may be tempting to lose yourself in the social whirl today but there are questions that need answering, questions that won’t go away just because you ignore them. You’ll find the answers you seek – IF you start looking now.|07-01-2014|sagittarius
210|Stop looking at your problems in such an emotional manner. Your feelings must not be allowed to come into it, especially where money and business issues are concerned. Practical problems require practical solutions, so make sure you use your head.|07-02-2014|sagittarius
211|Break a few rules and put a few noses out of joint today. The planets are urging you to do something out of the ordinary, something that stirs things up a bit in your quiet little corner of the world. Rock the boat and see who falls out!|07-03-2014|sagittarius
212|This may be a difficult day for you but it can also be a day when you learn something to your advantage. If you are torn between the future and the past, choose the future. If you are torn between your friends and money, choose friends.|07-04-2014|sagittarius
213|You need to come out from the shadows and remind those who may have forgotten who you are and what you can do. Believe in yourself and be ready to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. Be a doer, not a doubter.|07-05-2014|sagittarius
214|What others expect of you is irrelevant – the only thing that matters is what you expect of yourself. This will be one of those weeks when you must put your own interests first, even if it means other people lose out in some way.|07-06-2014|sagittarius
215|You may think your charm will get you everything you desire, and you may be right, but that is not an excuse to bend rules or cut corners. Everything balances out in the end, so if you cheat others now you will pay for it later.|07-07-2014|sagittarius
216|You are not the only one with good ideas, so listen to what friends and family members have to tell you over the next 24 hours and, if their advice sounds good, act on it immediately. Don’t let your ego get in the way.|07-08-2014|sagittarius
217|Put yourself forward and prove to the doubters you have what it takes. You may have to get tough, especially when dealing with people who try to play down your achievements, but you’ll make a good impression on those who matter.|07-09-2014|sagittarius
218|This should be a lucky day for you but a lot will depend on your own common sense, especially where money matters are concerned. Put your own interests first but be aware that your interests and other people’s interests are not far apart.|07-10-2014|sagittarius
219|If you are feeling a bit tongue-tied at the moment you should take that as a sign that it’s not the right time to speak up. If you say too much today and over the weekend you may have to unsay it again in the very near future.|07-11-2014|sagittarius
220|What you start this weekend could make you a considerable amount of money. If you are smart you will resist the urge to start a new project and instead redouble your efforts to finish the one you are on. That’s where the cash is.|07-12-2014|sagittarius
221|Someone new will come into your life this week and before you know it you will be the best of friends. It’s even possible that, in time, you will become more than friends, but even if there is an attraction there don’t rush things.|07-13-2014|sagittarius
222|Others may follow the old way of doing things but you are more adventurous than that. The planets encourage you to be inventive and original and if you are able to respond you will create something that will be praised far and wide.|07-14-2014|sagittarius
223|Someone seems to believe that you are an easy touch and that they can get what they want by appealing to your generous nature. Are they in for a shock! It’s time to be a bit more miserly, both with your affections and your money.|07-15-2014|sagittarius
224|The pace of life has been hectic of late and if you don’t take a break soon you might regret it. There is, though, still enough time for one last effort to complete something that means a lot to you. Get it finished today.|07-16-2014|sagittarius
225|The next few days will bring some nice surprises. It’s not often you are this lucky or this popular so make the most of it and don’t start thinking there is some kind of catch, because there isn’t. Be positive and act positive too.|07-17-2014|sagittarius
226|There is no need to rush and there is no need to impose deadlines on what you are doing. The more pressure you put on yourself the more likely it is you will make a mistake. Relax: everything will work out in the end.|07-18-2014|sagittarius
227|Decide on a course of action and stick to it. The more you chop and change the more likely it is your efforts will fall short and leave you feeling as if you have wasted your time and your talents. Focus your energy in a single direction.|07-19-2014|sagittarius
228|You should start feeling more like your old self over the next few days. With both the Sun and Jupiter, your ruler, transiting your fellow Fire sign of Leo you will have the confidence to try new things and visit new places. Have fun!|07-20-2014|sagittarius
229|You must be totally committed to what it is you are working on. If you are reluctant to get fully involved other people may decide they can do without you altogether – which won’t do your ego or your bank balance much good.|07-21-2014|sagittarius
230|The Sun’s change of signs today will broaden your horizons and make it easier for you to focus on the good things in life rather than the bad. Also, ideas that never meant much to you before will become a lot more important.|07-22-2014|sagittarius
231|The only danger now is that with so many marvelous things going on in your life you could let down your guard and let other people make decisions that are profitable for them but costly for you. Stay alert at all times.|07-23-2014|sagittarius
232|Confidence will not be in short supply over the next few days but what about common sense? The good news is you seem to have learnt how to set goals and pace yourself sensibly. You’ll go far. In fact you’ll go all the way.|07-24-2014|sagittarius
233|Others will go out of their way to pick holes in your arguments over the next 24 hours and you must go out of your way to ignore them. Having said that, there may be something you have overlooked, so be aware of other possibilities.|07-25-2014|sagittarius
234|If you feel strongly about something then act on it. Yes, it may make you unpopular in certain circles but that’s not important. What matters is that you can look in the mirror in the morning and like what you see. Principles matter.|07-26-2014|sagittarius
235|You need to question your attitude to your working routine and the effects it has been having on your health. Not even a Sagittarius can keep up the same frenetic pace day after day. Ask yourself: what can you do to slow things down a bit?|07-27-2014|sagittarius
236|Don’t just believe what other people tell you – go out into the world and experience it for yourself. Chances are you will discover that a lot of what you were told was nonsense. The only face you can trust is the one that stares back from the mirror.|07-28-2014|sagittarius
237|What can you do to make someone’s life more exciting and fulfilling? Time spent helping others will not be time wasted and your kind words and good deeds will have a ripple effect, making you a force for positive change.|07-29-2014|sagittarius
238|Be open to alternative viewpoints. The world is changing faster than ever and those who don’t try to keep up will get left behind quicker than they anticipated, so be alert to what is going on around you and be ready to move with the times.|07-30-2014|sagittarius
239|Others can do stupid things and waste their money if they wish but you have people depending on you and that means you must stay calm and stay focused on what is important. You’re a lot more responsible than most people appreciate.|07-31-2014|sagittarius
240|The upsets and restrictions of the past few months are beginning to fade and all you should care about today and over the weekend is having as much fun as possible. This is one of the best times of the year for you – so enjoy it.|08-01-2014|sagittarius
241|Today’s link between Mercury, planet of communication, and Jupiter, your ruler, will help you to reach out to people who share your passion and your principles. Together you will achieve something that makes the world sit up and take notice.|08-02-2014|sagittarius
242|Don’t start complaining that nothing seems to be going right for you at the moment because over the next seven days your fortunes will turn dramatically. The Sun is very much on your side at the moment, so show your positive side too.|08-03-2014|sagittarius
243|By all means be aware of other people’s doubts but don’t let them worry you. If you take everyone’s misgivings into account you won’t get much done. The important thing is that you have confidence in yourself. It’s really all you need.|08-04-2014|sagittarius
244|With the Sun, Mercury and Jupiter all moving through one of the most positive areas of your chart at the moment you can and you must do something out of the ordinary. Whatever you do it will be a huge success, so what are you waiting for?|08-05-2014|sagittarius
245|What happens around the time of the full moon at the weekend will turn everything upside-down, so there is no point taking anything too seriously. Go where there is laughter and fun and ignore those who say you are being irresponsible.|08-06-2014|sagittarius
246|Nothing is impossible. Some things, of course, may be more difficult and take more time than others but you can still find a way to realize your dreams. You will realize them quicker if you learn from those who have been there and done it already.|08-07-2014|sagittarius
247|No matter how busy you may be at the moment you won’t be satisfied until you have booked a vacation or promised friends that you will visit them over the weekend. Travel brings out the best in you. All work and no play just isn’t healthy.|08-08-2014|sagittarius
248|There is no need to be cautious. There is no need to hold back. On the contrary, this is the perfect time to take chances and make changes. There may be occasions when you push your luck too far but no harm will come of it.|08-09-2014|sagittarius
249|If you try to please all of the people all of the time you will end up pleasing no one, so you might as well just please yourself. This is one of those days when your generosity will be taken for granted, so don’t waste it.|08-10-2014|sagittarius
250|Life is good and getting better by the minute. Cosmic activity in your fellow Fire sign of Leo means more things will go right than go wrong over the next few days, so stop worrying, start smiling and make fun things happen.|08-11-2014|sagittarius
251|Generally your instincts are spot on but over the course of the next 24 hours you will have to admit that your negative views about a newcomer to your social circle were totally wrong. It seems they are a lot nicer than you thought.|08-12-2014|sagittarius
252|Some kind of crisis has almost reached breaking point and what happens today and tomorrow will finally take it over the top. If a relationship is on the slide don’t waste time trying to save it – the planets say it’s time to move on.|08-13-2014|sagittarius
253|No matter how eager you may be to get started on a new project you need to take time out and get your head around all the changes that are taking place in your world. Some serious thinking now will save time and energy later on.|08-14-2014|sagittarius
254|Mercury’s move into the career area of your chart makes this the ideal time to think about your ambitions. Is what you are doing now what you want to be doing long-term? If not, start planning some changes – and make them big.|08-15-2014|sagittarius
255|Honesty is the best policy but you may have to tell a small lie this weekend to save a friend from making a big mistake. If it’s the only way to make sure they stay out of trouble then go ahead, but don’t make a habit of it.|08-16-2014|sagittarius
256|Sometimes you can be too nice for your own good and that could be a problem this week. If you want to help people in need do so through a charitable organization – and make sure you know how your cash is being spent.|08-17-2014|sagittarius
257|Think only positive thoughts and only positive things will happen. Yes, it really is that easy. Create something out of the ordinary today by focusing your mind in a single direction. Extraordinary, even outrageous, things will start to occur very soon.|08-18-2014|sagittarius
258|These are exciting times for you but there is a danger you could burn yourself out, especially if you focus all your energy in a single direction. Big and beneficial changes are coming, so you need to stay sharp and stay fresh.|08-19-2014|sagittarius
259|The planets warn if you stick your nose in someone else’s business you may have trouble getting it out again. Do you really want to spend your time sorting out other people’s problems? Focus on what you enjoy and ignore everything else.|08-20-2014|sagittarius
260|A friend or family member may behave irrationally today but you should take it in your stride and take none of it too seriously. Sometimes people do things that don’t make any sense at all. You’ve done that a few times yourself!|08-21-2014|sagittarius
261|Nothing happens truly by chance and if you keep that fact in mind today you may find yourself in a position where you are able to gain an advantage over your rivals. Look for connections and, when you find them, make them work for you.|08-22-2014|sagittarius
262|As the Sun moves into the career area of your chart this weekend the ambitious side of your nature will come to the fore. Set yourself targets that stretch you but which you are still capable of reaching. Do more and do it better too.|08-23-2014|sagittarius
263|Put any doubts you may have behind you and go all out to prove to the world at large you have what it takes. Career-wise this is one of the best times of the year for getting things done, so stop dreaming and start doing.|08-24-2014|sagittarius
264|The Sun in the career area of your chart will boost your professional standing in some way over the next few weeks. If a new job offer comes along you must give it serious consideration. It may be a risky move but, then, life is an adventure.|08-26-2014|sagittarius
265|This is a busy time for you, so take regular breaks, maybe even a short vacation. There is no point running yourself into the ground, especially in pursuit of things of a material nature. Be kind to yourself over the next few days.|08-27-2014|sagittarius
266|At some point today you will have to make a difficult choice. Don’t worry what other people may think of it, or of you, worry only that if you don’t act soon the matter may be taken out of your hands once and for all.|08-28-2014|sagittarius
267|Make sure that what you are working on now is for your benefit, rather than the benefit of people who know they can look good simply by being on your side. Demand that everyone pulls their weight over the next 24 hours.|08-29-2014|sagittarius
268|Don’t think that just because your personal life is going okay at the moment that those around you feel great as well. Someone you are fond of desperately needs your assistance but is too shy to ask. Find out who it is and help them.|08-30-2014|sagittarius
269|You can now see that some of the conclusions you jumped to recently were utterly wrong. Therefore, your first act this week must be to apologize to those whose opinions you belittled. Next time, don’t be so fixed in your opinions. |08-31-2014|sagittarius
270|You seem to be getting along nicely with someone who a short while ago you thought of as your worst enemy. It’s funny how quickly things can change isn’t it? Now ask yourself: what can you change to make your financial situation more secure?|09-01-2014|sagittarius
271|Doors that have been closed to you in the past will open over the next few days. People who were reluctant to assist you before will now be falling over themselves to help you out. Don’t be afraid to move forwards – and fast.|09-02-2014|sagittarius
272|Others may be winding down a bit now but you must keep the tempo going and make sure you stay visible. There are some big opportunities coming up, so make sure important people know who you are, where you are and what you can do.|09-03-2014|sagittarius
273|There is an easy route and a difficult route to the place you want to be. It may be tempting to take the difficult route just so you can impress other people but why make life hard for yourself when you don’t have to? Enjoy the journey.|09-04-2014|sagittarius
274|If you need to ask someone in a position of authority for a favor this is one of the best times to approach them. For some reason they are in a charitable mood. It doesn’t matter why, it matters only that you take advantage of it.|09-05-2014|sagittarius
275|Although there are some details you can leave to other people this weekend the planets warn you must take care of the important stuff yourself. You also need to be on top of what’s going on at work, otherwise you’ll be at a disadvantage.|09-06-2014|sagittarius
276|Focus on things that highlight your strengths rather than things that highlight your weaknesses. No one expects you to be perfect but if you follow your instincts and be true to your nature you’ll come closer than most people manage.|09-07-2014|sagittarius
277|Your working routine is likely to be disrupted during the early part of the week but even if it is you won’t be too worried. There is so much going on in your life at the moment that you could probably do with a rest.|09-08-2014|sagittarius
278|Tread extra carefully when dealing with employers and other authority figures over the next 24 hours. You may feel you are on solid ground but today’s full moon could upset things by making some people far too emotional. Stay calm and carry on.|09-09-2014|sagittarius
279|Your attempt to resolve a domestic dispute of some kind is not going to work, at least not today. Neptune, planet of illusion, is making it increasingly hard to see what the real problem is, so stand away and give it some time.|09-10-2014|sagittarius
280|So many things have changed in your life of late that you could probably do with a few days when they stay just as they are. And that’s what is likely to happen as Saturn slows everything down. At last, you’ll get some peace.|09-11-2014|sagittarius
281|Come the weekend you will be free to express yourself in ways which may not have been possible before. However, you will also have to exercise a certain amount of self-discipline. If you say too much the backlash could be uncomfortable.|09-12-2014|sagittarius
282|Believe that nothing is beyond you this weekend. Believe that you can do as you please. After weeks, maybe months, of being told by the critics that you will never make it you now have the chance to prove them wrong. Take it.|09-13-2014|sagittarius
283|If you have agreed to take on certain responsibilities then you are obliged to see them through to the end. Yes, you can now see it was foolish to agree to things that do not inspire or benefit you personally but whose fault was that? |09-14-2014|sagittarius
284|You know a good thing when you see it and what you see today will get your mind racing. How can you make it work for you? How can you make it pay? Don’t let others tell you it’s selfish to think that way – it’s just common sense.|09-15-2014|sagittarius
285|Try not to be so self-critical. If something has not worked out the way you expected it to, well, that’s just the way it is. On this occasion you may have failed but it’s all good experience and next time you’ll get it right. Move on.|09-16-2014|sagittarius
286|The way you react to problems of a partnership nature is of the utmost importance today. If you criticize others too harshly then you must expect to make yourself unpopular – and most likely make matters worse. Strive to see the good in everyone.|09-17-2014|sagittarius
287|A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, so whatever it is you discover today don’t act on it yet. In the fullness of time you’ll find it is only half of the picture – and it’s the other half that matters more. Be patient.|09-18-2014|sagittarius
288|You may have strong views on controversial topics but the planets warn this is not the right time to make an issue of them. Wait until the Sun moves in your favor on the 23rd – then you can do your bit to save the world.|09-19-2014|sagittarius
289|A dispute of some kind may be upsetting but come the middle of next week the cosmic picture will look very different indeed. It seems this is one of those occasions when the air needs to be cleared so everyone involved can move on.|09-20-2014|sagittarius
290|Arguments of one sort or another are likely this week, so be careful you don’t open your mouth and put both feet in it! You have a tendency to speak first and worry about what you have said later. Okay, correction, sometimes you don’t worry at all.|09-21-2014|sagittarius
291|How much of what you believe is based on fact and how much is based on wishful thinking? That is what you need to discover as the Sun’s change of signs leads to a change of perspective as well. Don’t be afraid to junk old ideas.|09-23-2014|sagittarius
292|If you cannot fix something yourself today then ask for assistance. You have so many friends who will happily help you out but the first move must come from you. They know how snappy you can be if they get involved without being invited.|09-24-2014|sagittarius
293|You may recently have lost something of value but what you gain over the next few days will more than make up for it. Change is a constant in everyone’s lives but change does not have to be bad. Embrace the future.|09-25-2014|sagittarius
294|It would appear that on the work front someone is trying to undermine you by talking you down in front of employers and other important people. Don’t worry, they won’t get anywhere. The only success they will have is in making themselves look foolish.|09-26-2014|sagittarius
295|You may find it hard to get motivated this weekend but don’t worry about it. As mind planet Mercury moves into the most sensitive area of your chart you will want to spend more time thinking than doing. You’ll more than make up for it later.|09-27-2014|sagittarius
296|If you don’t care for a certain person there is no point pretending that you do. You must be honest about what you feel this coming week, otherwise you may find you are wasting time on people you have absolutely no interest in.|09-28-2014|sagittarius
297|Are you motivated by hope or by fear? As a larger-than-life Sag it’s more likely to be the former than the latter but there are still times when worry gets on top of you and that could easily happen today. Count your blessings, and celebrate them.|09-29-2014|sagittarius
298|You may find it hard to put your point of view across today, but that’s okay. There is actually nothing that needs to be said immediately, so keep quiet and use your time to improve your mind in some way. Read more, talk less!|09-30-2014|sagittarius
299|Your independence is precious to you and, sadly, that means you are likely to clash with someone who does not believe you should be allowed to have radical opinions. Will you be tactful about it? About as tactful as you usually are!|10-01-2014|sagittarius
300|Yes, you are highly independent, but there are some things that can only be done as part of a team. You may be eager to get things started but until those you work alongside are ready to begin you won’t make much progress.|10-02-2014|sagittarius
301|If you have something to say, something you suspect won’t go down well with certain people, you are advised to speak up before communications planet Mercury turns retrograde tomorrow. Leave it any longer and the words won’t make sense.|10-03-2014|sagittarius
302|Ease up a bit. Don’t push yourself so hard. The planets urge you to enjoy the kind of laidback weekend that has been few and far between in recent months. Give yourself permission to go wild for a while. No one can say you have not earned it.|10-04-2014|sagittarius
303|The approaching eclipse will help you see both sides of a dispute that threatens to disrupt your plans, which in turn will help you find ways to resolve it. Never forget there are two sides to every story – though there’s no such thing as fairy stories.|10-05-2014|sagittarius
304|Don’t change your plans because of a minor setback. What appears to be a disappointment now may, in the long-term, be a blessing in disguise. And remember: what was a good idea yesterday will probably still be a good idea tomorrow.|10-06-2014|sagittarius
305|Your circumstances will change for the better over the next few weeks but over the next few days there will be times when it seems as if things are moving backwards. Be patient. It will all come right in the end. Somehow it always does.|10-07-2014|sagittarius
306|You will find it easy to approach people today who in the past may have seemed distant or unfriendly. Most likely they only appeared that way because they were scared of your big personality! Break the ice and make new friendships.|10-08-2014|sagittarius
307|Try not to read into situations things which do not exist. Today’s cosmic picture is misleading to say the least, so don’t make decisions on what you think colleagues or loved ones have been saying – chances are you have misinterpreted their meaning.|10-09-2014|sagittarius
308|The nicer you are to someone today the more they will take liberties – it’s really that simple. The planets warn you won’t get anywhere by appealing to the better side of this person’s nature – there is a very good chance they simply don’t have one.|10-10-2014|sagittarius
309|If you allow emotional considerations to influence matters of common sense over the next 48 hours you may find around the middle part of next week that you have taken a completely wrong turning. Make sure your head rules your heart.|10-11-2014|sagittarius
310|You need to wake up to the fact that opportunities lie all around you. The planets indicate that someone in a position of authority is about to take a shine to you, so get serious about your ambitions. Show the world what you can do.|10-12-2014|sagittarius
311|You need to seize the initiative and make things happen. For some strange reason you have been a bit too fearful in recent weeks, and because of that opportunities have gone begging. Get your confidence back, then get on with making your mark.|10-13-2014|sagittarius
312|You may have strong opinions about serious issues but you don’t have to be aggressive about them. On the contrary, with Venus, planet of harmony, linked with your ruler Jupiter today you will accomplish much more if you talk and act nice.|10-14-2014|sagittarius
313|You will have to make a difficult decision over the next 24 hours but because you know without doubt what is right and what is wrong you will make it quickly and with a clear conscience. As a Fire sign you are never afraid to act.|10-15-2014|sagittarius
314|You may not be sure where an idea came from – was it conjured up by your own imagination or did you see or hear something that inspired you? – but you can and you must make good use of it. If you don’t, a rival most certainly will.|10-16-2014|sagittarius
315|If you push yourself beyond your natural limits today you may regret it come the start of next week. If you need to free up more time try wasting less of it on trivial pursuits. There are more than enough hours in a day to finish what needs to be done.|10-17-2014|sagittarius
316|Mars in your sign links with values planet Venus today, encouraging you to aim high when it comes to your beliefs and ideals. Others may say you are living in fantasy land, and maybe you are, but you’ve got to live somewhere, so why not there?|10-19-2014|sagittarius
317|Slow down a bit and prepare yourself, mentally, emotionally and physically, for the exertions that lie ahead. Don’t get involved in anything that is likely to drain your energy today. Your health and wellbeing are the only things that matter.|10-20-2014|sagittarius
318|What seemed fresh and exciting a while back now seems dull and boring, but is that really the case or is it just because you have allowed your mind to get stuck in a rut? The only person who can make it fresh and exciting again is you.|10-21-2014|sagittarius
319|Don’t let people in positions of power intimidate you. You can be your own worst enemy at times, not least because you doubt, for no good reason, that you have what it takes to compete and succeed at the highest level. But you do, you do!|10-22-2014|sagittarius
320|You may want the good times to last forever but deep down you know you need to get serious and, among other things, turn your attention inward, to what makes you tick. It’s not true that Sags don’t know how to think, and you’ll prove it today.|10-23-2014|sagittarius
321|Your imagination is extremely active at the moment, which means you should make a point of focusing on good things only. If you let negative thoughts take hold they will be very hard to shake off again. Reality begins in the mind.|10-24-2014|sagittarius
322|Money issues of one sort or another will come to the fore over the next 48 hours and you MUST do something about them. If you don’t you can be sure that other people will and it will be you who ends up paying the most.|10-25-2014|sagittarius
323|There are so many things you would like to change in your life but there is one thing, and one thing only, that demands to be altered. You know what it is and you know you have been putting it off. Time to get serious and get busy. |10-26-2014|sagittarius
324|You may feel that a situation is getting out of hand but is it as bad as you fear? Probably not. Sometimes you fear the worst even when you have every reason to expect the best. Have a little more faith in the goodness of the world.|10-27-2014|sagittarius
325|What can you do to make the world a better place? What can you do to make a difference to other people’s lives? The planets indicate you can be a force for good over the next few days. How? By acting according to your highest principles.|10-28-2014|sagittarius
326|For some reason certain people seem determined to find fault with your performance, but now that you know that you can take steps to make sure your performance is excellent. If you can, find ways to turn their criticism back at them.|10-29-2014|sagittarius
327|You may feel as if you are getting nowhere fast at the moment but on a deeper level you are in fact making considerable progress. What takes place in your subconscious mind will eventually filter through to your daily life.|10-30-2014|sagittarius
328|Something you believed in for a long time now appears to be misguided and you may be a bit embarrassed that you supported it so strongly. Don’t be. There’s nothing wrong with strong opinions. The important thing is you learned from the experience.|11-02-2014|sagittarius
329|A major change of direction is not needed, despite what some people may be telling you. All you require is a little more faith in your own abilities. No way are your rivals more creative than you – you’re in a league of your own. |11-03-2014|sagittarius
330|Plans made over the weekend may have to be changed or abandoned as reality sets in. The simple fact is you do not have the time or the resources to do what you said you would do. Next time, don’t make promises so easily.|11-04-2014|sagittarius
331|Why are you so determined to look on the gloomy side of life? No doubt it has something to do with all that cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart but you don’t have to worry. Smile – life is still good. |11-05-2014|sagittarius
332|Before embarking on a course of action that you have no way of knowing will work out well or badly, ask yourself if it is really what you want. It could be you have made a snap decision based on emotion rather than common sense.|11-07-2014|sagittarius
333|There may be times today and over the weekend when it seems as if there are new difficulties to overcome in every direction, but is that actually so or is it your mind playing tricks on you? Most likely it’s the latter, so don’t be too concerned. |11-08-2014|sagittarius
334|You have made more than enough excuses for a friend or colleague whose behavior has been, to say the least, questionable. Let them know that the next time they make a major error of judgement they are on their own – and mean it.|11-09-2014|sagittarius
335|What is it you want the most? Once you have put a name to your desire you will be amazed how easy it is to make it your own. This is also a good time to get serious about your cash flow situation. Earn more or spend less.|11-10-2014|sagittarius
336|A missed opportunity to communicate may not seem important now but it will cost time and energy you can ill afford later on. Don’t plan what you have to say, just say it and let the words find their own way to the target. |11-11-2014|sagittarius
337|Your main problem at the moment seems to be that you are trying to do everything at once. The kind of changes you envisage will take a long time to bring about, maybe even a lifetime, so pace yourself. Ultimately, it’s the journey that matters.|11-12-2014|sagittarius
338||11-13-2014|sagittarius
339|Something will challenge your established opinions today and you could even find yourself agreeing with ideas and theories you once dismissed as rubbish. One of the good things about your sign is that you are willing to move with the times.  |11-14-2014|sagittarius
340|Good fortune will come your way this weekend and you thoroughly deserve it. The entry of values planet Venus into your sign means you will realize just how lucky you are, in love and in life in general. Enjoy every moment of it. |11-15-2014|sagittarius
341|Not all the comments aimed in your direction this week will be flattering but you are not the sort to let that worry you. With the Sun moving into your sign in a matter of days it’s what you do that matters, not what others say.|11-16-2014|sagittarius
342|Don’t try to finish something that has become a bit of a chore in recent weeks. The reason you have lost interest in it is because your attitude towards it has changed. It may have been important yesterday but it is no longer important today.|11-18-2014|sagittarius
343|You have important business to finish and you must not let anyone stand in your way. Also, don’t let yourself be distracted by issues that, while they may be a lot of fun, have no relevance to the task at hand. Be direct. Be decisive. |11-19-2014|sagittarius
344|It would appear that someone has taken your fancy but if you are smart you won’t give them the impression that you are desperate. If you do all the chasing at the beginning of your relationship that will be the pattern for the future as well. |11-20-2014|sagittarius
345|With mind planet Mercury linked to Mars today you will at long last be able to put a name to what has been worrying you for days, weeks, even months. Now you know what it is you must be positive and do something about.|11-21-2014|sagittarius
346|There is magic in the air this weekend. With the Sun’s move into your birth sign followed immediately by a powerful new moon there is nothing you cannot do. Don’t try to do everything though. Focus your energy in a single direction. |11-22-2014|sagittarius
347|Romantic Venus’s link to changes planet Uranus in midweek means that logic and reason are of secondary importance. It is love that makes the world go round and it is love you must allow to guide you. It will take you to some enjoyable places.|11-23-2014|sagittarius
348|No one doubts your appetite for hard work but even a Sag needs to slow down once in a while. Venus in your birth sign urges you match each hour of work you do with an hour of relaxation. Your wellbeing is important. |11-24-2014|sagittarius
349|Just because you see things differently to most other people does not mean you are out of step – it could mean you are the only one who knows where you are going. If friends tell you one thing but your instincts tell you another, trust your instincts. |11-25-2014|sagittarius
350|Try not to say anything too drastic or hurtful today or it may take weeks or even months to win back a loved one’s trust. Sometimes you speak without thinking and give others the impression you don’t care about their feelings. |11-26-2014|sagittarius
351|The obvious solution to a problem is not necessarily the right one and today’s cosmic outlook urges you to try something that has not been done before. It may or may not come off but it will definitely expand your outlook, and that’s good. |11-27-2014|sagittarius
352|There are certain things in your world that have become too predictable and need shaking up. The entry of Mercury into your sign today will encourage you to begin new habits and routines. Take a risk if you have to – it’s what Sag is all about.|11-28-2014|sagittarius
353|Time spent checking details this weekend will not be time wasted. This is your time of the year and no doubt you are eager to be on the move and get important things done, but whatever it is you are aiming to do you must plan ahead.|11-29-2014|sagittarius
354|There is nothing you cannot do – or persuade other people to do for you – if you put your mind to it. Travel and social plans are highlighted this week and once Mars changes signs on Thursday you will be even more adventurous than usual.|11-30-2014|sagittarius
355|It is time to stop daydreaming and get down to essentials. What exists in your mind’s eye could and should exist in the real world too, so quit with the excuses and make it happen. According to the planets it really is now or never. |12-01-2014|sagittarius
356|You may have good reason to be annoyed with a certain individual but is it worth the effort and the anguish? Probably not. You may not be able to forgive but you can certainly forget – for your benefit, not theirs|12-02-2014|sagittarius
357|You can find it hard to apply yourself to routine tasks and that will be even more of a problem than usual today and tomorrow. If you feel the need to get out into the world and explore then do so. Don’t let anything hold you back.|12-03-2014|sagittarius
358|Today’s Sun-Uranus link means there are major changes on the way, changes that will benefit you in so many ways. If there is a creative project you have been toying with now is the time to get serious about it. Make it work.|12-04-2014|sagittarius
359|Your main task today is to look rationally at what is upsetting you. Stand back from your personal feelings and ask yourself if it is of any real importance. Most likely it isn’t, so why waste time getting worked up about it? |12-05-2014|sagittarius
360|A full moon in your opposite sign of Gemini will make emotional upsets seem more important than they are this weekend. A friend or relative may not be as pleasant as usual but that does not mean they no longer like you.|12-06-2014|sagittarius
361|You may be desperate to get things moving again but with Jupiter, your ruler, turning retrograde this week you will have to accept that some people don’t want to be rushed. If you can’t beat them join them – take your time and get it right.|12-07-2014|sagittarius
362|You know that what you believe in is right and you know that what someone else believes in is totally and utterly wrong. How do you convince them to change their outlook? You don’t. Let them learn from their own mistakes. |12-08-2014|sagittarius
363|Sometimes you are suspicious for no good reason but today you are right to be skeptical of what you see and hear. Most of all you need to question what work colleagues are telling you – it could be a complete pack of lies. |12-09-2014|sagittarius
364|You need to turn your attention to matters of a financial nature. It could well be the case that you have spent too much in recent weeks and with values planet Venus moving into the money area of your chart you must find ways to make savings.|12-10-2014|sagittarius
365|Mercury in your sign fills your head with lots of ideas, but how do you decide which are good and which are bad? Fortunately you don’t have to decide immediately. Just note your ideas down somewhere safe and come back to them later.|12-11-2014|sagittarius
366|There may be times when you think that your lucky streak has come to an end but it’s not nearly over yet. The only thing that might hold you back is if you allow negative thoughts to take root. It’s all good – so enjoy life.|12-12-2014|sagittarius
367|Don’t try to force your ideas on other people – gentle persuasion is by far the best policy, especially when dealing with those who are naturally skeptical. The softer you speak the more they will believe you know what you are talking about.|12-13-2014|sagittarius
368|Be confident by all means but don’t start thinking you can do what you like, when you like, to who you like with no risk of payback. There is a danger this week that you could go too far and set yourself up for a fall.|12-14-2014|sagittarius
369|If you let your emotions get the better of you today you will most likely regret it later in the week. However bad you think something may be, and however bad it may actually be, it really isn’t worth getting worked up about. |12-16-2014|sagittarius
370|You won’t lack for confidence today – you are in one of those moods when the thought of failure does not enter your head and because of that you could succeed beyond your wildest dreams. Or you could fall flat on your face! |12-17-2014|sagittarius
371|Do you give a colleague your support and risk falling out with someone in authority? Or do you side with the powers that be and risk losing a friend? Only you can decide but it’s got to be one or the other. You can’t fudge the issue. |12-18-2014|sagittarius
372|Friends may not be as supportive as you would like them to be but don’t let that stop you pursuing your goals. You don’t need anyone to endorse your ambitions, you just need to get on and do what you know to be right.|12-19-2014|sagittarius
373|You need to find ways to boost your income and the Sun’s move into the money area of your chart will certainly help. Don’t dismiss a creative idea that pops into your head as too outrageous – it could be the solution you’ve been searching for.|12-20-2014|sagittarius
374|The Sun leaves your sign today and there is a new moon in the money area of your chart tomorrow, which suggests you now have to pay for something you got a great deal of enjoyment from in recent weeks. It was worth every cent!|12-21-2014|sagittarius
375|Unexpected changes may unsettle you today but it won’t be long before you regain your balance and find ways to make them pay. As one of the zodiac’s more flexible signs you find it easy to adapt to new situations.|12-22-2014|sagittarius
376|Saturn’s move into your sign today marks the start of a two-year phase that will test you. That may not sound like fun but the good news is you can handle whatever life throws at you – in fact you will enjoy the challenge.|12-23-2014|sagittarius
377|You may seem rough and tough to some people but deep down you are a big softie and what happens today will prove it. Someone who needs a helping hand will have much to thank you for. It could be the start of a beautiful friendship. |12-24-2014|sagittarius
378|Yours is a sign noted for its enthusiasm, but too much of the stuff today could cause you problems, so think before you act. If there are a lot of little jobs that have to be done, consider paying someone to do them for you. |12-25-2014|sagittarius
379|There is no such thing as a sure thing and if you keep that fact in mind today you won’t go far wrong. Certainly not as wrong as some of your friends, who seem to think they can do as they please and get away with it. |12-26-2014|sagittarius
380|Be nice by all means this weekend but don’t let someone off the hook when they clearly do not deserve it. If you want to avoid problems in the future it might be a smart move to come down on them hard in the present. |12-27-2014|sagittarius
381|Money matters will be top of your agenda as you go into the new year and that’s good because you really do need to get your financial house in order. If getting rich is part of your life plan it won’t just happen as if by magic!|12-28-2014|sagittarius
382|Your logic circuits don’t appear to be functioning too well at the moment, so it might be wise to resist making any major decisions, especially where money matters are concerned. Later in the week your mind will click into gear again. |12-29-2014|sagittarius
383|With so many things going right for you now you can afford to smile, and come the end of the week you will be laughing out loud. Make sure you laugh with people though and not at them. Help others smile too. |12-30-2014|sagittarius
384|Give yourself a break and let other people do the heavy lifting. It is unlikely you will get much of any real value done today, so you might as well sit back and watch the passing parade. It should be good for a laugh or two.|12-31-2014|sagittarius
385|You are not the sort to keep quiet, especially when you feel there has been an injustice of some sort, and you will speak your mind today regardless of what the consequences might be. Good for you – someone needs to make a fuss. |01-01-2015|sagittarius
386|You have spent so much time doing things for other people – don’t you think it’s time you did something for yourself? If you get the chance to enjoy yourself today take it and don’t feel guilty. You have earned the right to have fun.|01-02-2015|sagittarius
387|Trust your instincts this weekend, even if no one else does. Where both money matters and affairs of the heart are concerned only you know what is best for your happiness and security, so only you can make those big decisions. |01-03-2015|sagittarius
388|You may be a bit impulsive over the next two or three days, especially where money matters are concerned. You want so much to be a success that you may be tempted to do something rash, which could lead to an embarrassing failure. |01-04-2015|sagittarius
389|Today’s full moon suggests you will have to loosen your hold on something you cherish. It may be painful to begin with it won’t be long before you feel a real sense of freedom – you were the one who was being held back.|01-05-2015|sagittarius
390|Don’t let other people’s complaints and criticisms get to you today. You may look confident on the outside but a worm of doubt is burrowing its way into your mind and your rivals will play on that if you give them the chance.|01-06-2015|sagittarius
391|Be careful what you say over the next 24 hours because if you say too much you could hurt a friend’s feelings and chances are they won’t be a friend for much longer. Sometimes you can be rather abrupt in your pronouncements. |01-07-2015|sagittarius
392|According to the planets you will be taking some important decisions over the next 24 hours. The most important thing of all is that you make it clear to everyone that these decisions are not open to discussion. You have decided and that’s it. |01-08-2015|sagittarius
393|According to the planets a colleague is envious of your popularity and success and would like nothing better than to bring you down a notch or two. That can only happen if you drop your guard – so stay alert for challenges. |01-09-2015|sagittarius
394|This should be a lucky time for you, especially if you are on the move. The more you get out and about the more likely it is you will see or hear something that can be turned to your advantage. So why are you still here?|01-10-2015|sagittarius
395|Mars moves into one of the more sensitive areas of your chart this week, which warns you could easily overreact and start a fight over something of no real importance. Save your energy, and your anger, for the issues that really matter. |01-11-2015|sagittarius
396|Anyone who thinks they can persuade you or coerce you to do something you do not approve of is living in cloud cuckoo land. When it comes to family matters though try not to take such a hard-line stance. Be flexible.|01-12-2015|sagittarius
397|Take extra care when dealing with someone you don’t know much about. They may talk big and try to make you believe they are experts in their chosen field but do you have any real evidence of that? Don’t put your money where their mouth is. |01-13-2015|sagittarius
398|You will have to deal with someone today who is so slow and so indecisive that it drives you mad. The sad fact is not everyone thinks or acts as quickly as you and sometimes you just have to wait for the slowest one in the group. |01-14-2015|sagittarius
399|Don’t try too hard to keep your emotions bottled up because it will be better for your health if you let your feelings show. You also need to prove that you are not intimidated by people who throw their weight around. |01-15-2015|sagittarius
400|The next few days will be lucky for you and what you gain you will thoroughly deserve. Not everyone will agree with that conclusion but not everyone is aware how hard you have worked to get to your current position. |01-16-2015|sagittarius
401|You need to get your financial house in order before the Sun changes signs on the 20th. That means looking for ways to cut back on your spending. You would be the first to admit you have been a little bit extravagant of late. |01-17-2015|sagittarius
402|Don’t worry if you don’t have much money in your pocket as the new week begins, because you will meet up with someone who enjoys buying you things. What will they ask for in return? The pleasure of your company of course! |01-18-2015|sagittarius
403|If a friend or colleague asks for your opinion about something it will pay you to say what you think they want to hear, even if you actually believe the opposite. Arguments of all kinds are best avoided over the next 24 hours. |01-19-2015|sagittarius
404|This is a good time for traveling and having fun with your friends. Don’t worry if you are a bit short of cash because you will meet up with someone who enjoys buying you things. All they want in return is the pleasure of your company.|01-20-2015|sagittarius
405|Someone may say you have no right to occupy a certain position but as far as you are concerned possession is nine-tenths of the law and you intend to stay right where you are. Who is brave enough to challenge you?|01-21-2015|sagittarius
406|You may have a thousand and one issues to deal with (yes, you do like to exaggerate!) but you must still find time to let loved ones know they mean the world to you. Remember, it’s not about “me” it’s about “us.”|01-22-2015|sagittarius
407|By helpful by all means today but be wary too, especially of people who try to persuade you to lend them money. According to the planets they are up to no good, so keep your money in your pocket where it belongs.|01-23-2015|sagittarius
408|Chances are you will run out of patience with someone you work with this weekend. Spell it out for them that if they can’t keep up then you will leave them behind. You don’t have the time or the patience to deal with stragglers. |01-24-2015|sagittarius
409|During the early part of the week you may be rather reserved and not much interested in socializing but later you will come out of your shell and get more involved in life. If you are owed a favor, ask for it to be repaid. |01-25-2015|sagittarius
410|You may find it hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys today, so be on your guard and take nothing for granted. You could also read too much into perfectly normal situations, so don’t jump to conclusions.|01-26-2015|sagittarius
411|What looks like a failure at the beginning of the day will look like a success by the end of the day, which is nice. Also, if you listen to the advice of a well-connected friend you could make some serious money.|01-27-2015|sagittarius
412|A friend or relative will say something thoughtless today and although you won’t let it show your feelings will be hurt. But don’t start plotting your revenge because it’s unlikely they meant to be spiteful. They just didn’t think. |01-28-2015|sagittarius
413|You are at your best when dealing with people on a one-to-one basis, so forget about your chores and get out into the world and have fun. Does that make you irresponsible? In some people’s eyes maybe, but you just don’t care. |01-29-2015|sagittarius
414|You keep asking yourself all sorts of questions but the answers are so slow in coming. Don’t let it worry you because some answers always take longer to arrive than others. Just be patient and keep that big brain of yours ticking over. |01-30-2015|sagittarius
415|Everything is going right for you at the moment, so why do you have that horrible feeling of impending doom? Whatever the reason you really have little to worry about. Whatever challenges life brings you will handle them with ease.|01-31-2015|sagittarius
416|You will say some outrageous things over the next few days but there is every chance that you will get away with it. People expect you to be controversial and outspoken, so go right ahead and stir things up a little – or a lot! |02-01-2015|sagittarius
417|There seems to be a lot of tension in your dealings with other people at the moment, both in your personal affairs and at work. The good news is that tension can be creative. Use it as a source of power to get things done. |02-02-2015|sagittarius
418|Social activities will be a lot of fun today and romance is on the cards as well. What starts out as just a friendship could grow deep and serious very quickly – it will certainly be more than just another fling.|02-03-2015|sagittarius
419|Life is too short to worry about what other people think of you, so follow your desires come what may. You have played by the book far too often of late, so now go to the other extreme and try being outrageous. |02-04-2015|sagittarius
420|If someone says you need to be cautious you should listen to, and act on, their advice. It may not be your natural way of doing things but a few days from now you can make up for it by going to the other extreme. |02-05-2015|sagittarius
421|If you allow fear to guide your thoughts and actions you will miss out on something that could make your life so much more enjoyable. Why should you be afraid of something just because it’s new? Embrace the future. |02-06-2015|sagittarius
422|Spend more time with partners and loved ones this weekend. It does not matter how important your work may be, your family is more important by far and now is the ideal time to make sure they know that.|02-07-2015|sagittarius
423|Take a friend’s tip-off seriously because their expert knowledge could help you make some extra cash over the next few days. You can be sure if you don’t take advantage of it someone else will, so don’t be slow off the mark. |02-08-2015|sagittarius
424|Spell out what it is you are planning to do and let friends and work colleagues know you could do with some assistance. Chances are they will rush to your side and do whatever they can to help. They know a winner when they see one. |02-09-2015|sagittarius
425|Someone you work or do business with will be hard to pin down today but before you get angry about it consider that maybe it’s what they want you to do. If you lose your temper it will just make them look good.|02-10-2015|sagittarius
426|If you get the chance to do a good deed for a friend or colleague over the next two or three days don’t wait to be asked, just wade in and put things right for them. You will earn their eternal gratitude. |02-11-2015|sagittarius
427|Someone will annoy you big time today. No matter what you say or do they will disagree with you and attempt to derail your plans. They can only succeed if you let them though, so be tough without getting angry. |02-12-2015|sagittarius
428|One way or another you must get your message across. Hopefully people will stop what they are doing and listen to what you have to say but, if not, grab hold of them and yell at them face-to-face. They will hear you okay.|02-13-2015|sagittarius
429|Something you have been planning for ages is almost ready to launch but before you get at it you must let loved ones know what it is you are up to. If nothing else it will save them from thinking you’ve lost your mind! |02-15-2015|sagittarius
430|Your values will change somewhat over the next few days. What you think you believe in today may not be what you believe in come the end of the month, and that’s good because it shows you are still evolving mentally. |02-16-2015|sagittarius
431|Minor disagreements could get out of hand today, so promise yourself now that no matter what the provocation might be you won’t rise to the bait. Whatever the issue happens to be it’s not worth getting worked up about. |02-17-2015|sagittarius
432|The cosmic changes now taking place will help you get to grips with issues that have been causing you grief. On the home front especially you need to realize just how petty and unnecessary certain things are. Time to move on. |02-18-2015|sagittarius
433|Social activities will be a lot of fun over the next few days but the downside is you will spend too much money. If you have to go cap in hand to a friend or relative for a loan later expect them to want something in return.|02-19-2015|sagittarius
434|Don’t make any travel plans for today or tomorrow because there is something special coming your way and if you move you may miss it – or, more likely, it will miss you. You’re right where you should be, so stay put.|02-20-2015|sagittarius
435|Whatever you begin over the next 48 hours will end in triumph at some stage in the not too distant future, so be bold and be the one who acts first and makes things happen. Creativity plus courage equals guaranteed success. |02-21-2015|sagittarius
436|You will have to deal with people who can’t think clearly this week and there will be times when you could scream at them. Don’t. It will only make matters worse and maybe even reduce them to tears. Some people are just so fragile. |02-22-2015|sagittarius
437|Saturn in your sign at odds with the Sun today means you must not get worked up about something which, in the greater scheme of things, is of only minor importance. Also, if something is denied you it means you are not supposed to have it. |02-23-2015|sagittarius
438|By all means plan ahead but try not to actually do anything. If you give your brain a rest today it will be working better than ever later in the week, and that’s when the important decisions will have to be made.|02-24-2015|sagittarius
439|If you need to persuade someone to see things your way or to do you a favor this is the time to make your play. They have no defense against your charm, your energy and your way with words. You’re irresistible! |02-25-2015|sagittarius
440|You will have words with someone whose personality or behavior rubs you up the wrong way. Less timid souls might keep their opinions to themselves but you’re not the kind to back off. Why should you when you’re the one in the right? |02-26-2015|sagittarius
441|If someone throws their weight around today your first instinct will be to start throwing things back at them, but don’t be too hasty. A more effective response is to ignore them and starve them of the attention they so obviously crave.|02-27-2015|sagittarius
442|You won’t let anyone take liberties over the next 48 hours – in fact your ruler Jupiter is so strong at the moment that you will get your way through sheer force of personality. No one is big enough or brash enough to oppose you.|02-28-2015|sagittarius
443|This will either be a week to remember or a week to forget, depending on how ready you are to adapt to changing circumstances. If you go with the flow you will achieve great things. If you swim against the tide you may get swept away. |03-01-2015|sagittarius
444|You will have to deal with someone who hates to take risks – in fact they are the opposite of you in every way. According to the planets you will need this individual’s assistance in the near future, so be nice – or at least pretend. |03-02-2015|sagittarius
445|You don’t need anyone’s permission to have fun today. If life has been a bit dull of late then by all means spice things up. No doubt some people will remind you that these are serious times but that just makes laughter all the more valuable.|03-04-2015|sagittarius
446|By all means listen to what others have to tell you today but don’t think for a moment that you are obliged to do what they suggest. In fact you are advised to hold off making any kind of major move while the moon is full.|03-05-2015|sagittarius
447|The thing to keep in mind is that you have nothing to prove. Certain people will try to make you feel like a failure but the only real failures are those who never aim high or take risks – and no one can say that of you.|03-06-2015|sagittarius
448|No matter how ambitious a Sagittarius you happen to be you will find it difficult to get excited about work matters this weekend, and that’s good because they are not that important. What is important is your love life. It should be enjoyable too.|03-07-2015|sagittarius
449|Cosmic activity in the most energetic area of your chart means you won’t take no for an answer, and nor should you. Some people may try to tell you that your aims are unrealistic but they’re jealous because they are not as dynamic as you.|03-08-2015|sagittarius
450|Focus on what really matters. It may be hard for someone like you who is so easily bored to concentrate on just one thing at a time but it must be done if you are to make progress. What is your number one goal? Go for it! |03-09-2015|sagittarius
451|Cosmic activity in your fellow Fire signs of Aries and Leo means everything comes easy to you at the moment. But that does not mean you no longer have to make an effort. On the contrary, the harder you work the easier it will get.|03-10-2015|sagittarius
452|There is good in everybody and if you sometimes find that hard to believe what happens by the end of the day will surely convince you. It won’t take much to restore your faith in human nature. Try not to misplace it again.|03-11-2015|sagittarius
453|Saturn in your sign warns that life is not as straightforward as you seem to think it is. What happens over the next few days, as Saturn begins one of its retrograde phases, will encourage you to plan ahead and not leave so much to chance.|03-12-2015|sagittarius
454|What you choose to do today may annoy some people but don’t let that stop you. The fact is you have done plenty of things to please them in the past and now you intend doing something to please yourself. About time.|03-13-2015|sagittarius
455|What other people want is irrelevant – it’s what you want that matters. The planets indicate that certain individuals have been playing on your feelings and making you feel guilty so they benefit. It’s time to get tough and take back control.|03-14-2015|sagittarius
456|Devote your time and energy during the early part of the new week to ironing out any emotional problems you may have with loved ones and relatives. No problem is so big or so bad that it cannot be resolved by honest communication. |03-15-2015|sagittarius
457|Nothing in your life is so urgent that it must be done right this very moment and if anyone tells you otherwise they are not to be trusted. Bide your time and let others make the first move. You can learn from their mistakes. |03-16-2015|sagittarius
458|Start something new today, something that helps you contribute more to the world around you. When the Sun changes signs at the end of the week you will find it suddenly takes off – and your reputation will take off with it.|03-17-2015|sagittarius

460|Challenges are opportunities in disguise – which means you will have at least one and maybe several opportunities to shine over the next few days. Don’t let what happened – or did not happen – in the past hold you back. It’s different now. |03-19-2015|sagittarius
461|Set your sights high and refuse to settle for second best. Your confidence will soar over the next few days and you will start to believe that anything is possible. One of the best times of the year is about to begin. Make every minute count.|03-20-2015|sagittarius
462|Will fortune smile on you and make all your dreams come true? Maybe, although it’s likely to be a bit of an exaggeration, but make no mistake: now the Sun is transiting your fellow Fire sign of Aries all things are possible – for you. |03-21-2015|sagittarius
463|Be nice to someone you don’t feel like being nice to over the next 24 hours – and something nice will happen to you later in the week. This is one of those occasions when what you do comes back to you almost instantly. |03-22-2015|sagittarius
464|Something you say may hurt a friend’s feelings but don’t worry about it because they are not as weak as they like to make out. Call it as you see it. You don’t have to tone down your comments just to make others feel good.  |03-23-2015|sagittarius
465|You can expect almost everyone you meet to be nice to you today and, of course, you will be nice in return. However, don’t let your guard down completely because at least one such “nice” individual has designs on your money.|03-24-2015|sagittarius
466|Someone you live or work with will get the wrong end of the stick today and blame you for something that is not your fault. By all means clear your name and demand an apology but don’t hold it against them. Everyone makes mistakes. |03-25-2015|sagittarius
467|This is a good time to think of ways to reduce your daily chores and also to improve your health. You may not be able to make any major changes for two or three weeks but you can and should make plans now – it’s a start.|03-26-2015|sagittarius
468|Your generosity knows no bounds: you want to do everything for everyone. Common sense should tell you that isn’t actually possible but you will do your best to make a positive difference in the world over the next 24 hours.|03-27-2015|sagittarius
469|If you have been aiming too high or taking too much for granted you will find out about it over the next 48 hours. Whatever happens you will certainly have to cut back on unnecessary expenditure. Money doesn’t grow on trees you know.|03-28-2015|sagittarius
470|It’s not like you to stay quiet but for some reason you feel you cannot speak freely. The good news is that when Mercury, planet of communication, changes signs on Tuesday you will be invited to have your say – and you won’t hold back.|03-29-2015|sagittarius
471|You can turn almost any situation to your advantage now but don’t get carried away and take on someone who is obviously several leagues above you on the power ladder. There is always someone stronger or better connected, even for a Sagittarius. |03-30-2015|sagittarius
472|Why is it that every other person you meet wants to start a fight? Whatever the reason – and there may be no real reason at all – you must resist the urge to get involved. There is no percentage in it. Whatever the outcome, you will lose. |03-31-2015|sagittarius
473|You need to be on top of your game today, physically, mentally and emotionally, and that means a positive attitude is a must. Don’t let anyone tell you that you are aiming too high or expecting too much because it isn’t true.|04-01-2015|sagittarius
474|Today’s link between the Sun and your ruling planet Jupiter means you can get away with almost anything. No, that is not an invitation to break the law but you can push the boundaries a bit, and a big bit at that.|04-02-2015|sagittarius
475|Speak up and let others know what you think and how you feel. The current cosmic outlook gives you the courage to say things that are unlikely to go down well with people in positions of power, but don’t let that stop you.|04-03-2015|sagittarius
476|Do your own thing in your own way and at your own speed and ignore those who say you could be putting your time and energy to better use. Who knows, they may be right, but if you’re happy then nothing else matters, does it?|04-04-2015|sagittarius
477|Monday’s Sun-Uranus link highlights the lighter side of life, so don’t tie yourself down with the kind of duties and chores you find boring. You are not the kind to be serious – you are at your best when there is a smile on your face. |04-05-2015|sagittarius
478|Start something new and don’t worry too much about planning ahead. Today’s cosmic influences urge you to think and act as if you cannot possibly fail – and you won’t. The universe knows where you should be going, so let your inner voice guide you.|04-06-2015|sagittarius
479|It’s just as well you enjoy multi-tasking because partners and colleagues will have you running in all directions today. But don’t let it get to the stage where you begin to lose track of what you have done and what you still have to do.|04-07-2015|sagittarius
480|With the Sun, Mercury and Uranus moving through one of the most dynamic areas of your chart you should be out there in the world making things happen. And if you can’t make things happen where you are, get up and go some place else.|04-08-2015|sagittarius
481|Whatever you start now will bring success in the not too distant future, so make it special and make it something you can look back on with pride in years to come. It’s time to let your creative side come to the fore.|04-09-2015|sagittarius
482|Others may say you are being too careful, and maybe you are, but don’t change your ways to please them. Looked at from another perspective it’s not you who is being too careful but they who are taking too many chances.|04-10-2015|sagittarius
483|You must put all thoughts of revenge out of your head this weekend. Whatever may have happened in the past should be left in the past – there can be no room for it in the new life you are building. Lighten up Sagittarius/|04-11-2015|sagittarius
484|Some of the people you meet over the next few days will get on your nerves big time. No matter what you say or how agreeable you try to be they will find reasons to criticize. Don’t let it get to you – they’re to be pitied really.|04-12-2015|sagittarius
485|Your powers of persuasion are at a peak and somehow you will know just what to say and just how to say it for maximum effect. Whatever you want over the next few days you will get – no one will be able to refuse you. |04-13-2015|sagittarius
486|What you do for or to other people always comes back to you eventually, and if you bear that thought in mind today, and act accordingly, you won’t go far wrong. It’s always better to give than to receive – in the short-term anyway.|04-14-2015|sagittarius
487|Stop worrying about whether or not you are doing the right thing and live the way you feel is right. You don’t have to make a special effort to impress people today – in fact you don’t have to make an effort at all. It’s time to relax.|04-15-2015|sagittarius
488|Look for a compromise solution to some kind of dispute. Yes, you may honestly believe that you are blameless and that the other party should admit that fact and make concessions but it isn’t going to happen. Meet them halfway. |04-17-2015|sagittarius
489|Today’s new moon in the sympathetic sign of Aries means that all things are possible for you now. Aim high creatively and romantically and don’t doubt for a moment that you will get what you desire. No one will dare to deny you! |04-18-2015|sagittarius
490|Sometimes you need to be tough and sometimes you need to be tender and over the coming week you will need to use both approaches. Make sure you get them the right way round. If not, you will make enemies of just about everyone! |04-19-2015|sagittarius
491|You will be the center of attention for all the right reasons over the next 24 hours. Your wit and your charm will attract others to you like moths to a flame. You know all the right words and all the right tricks to get noticed.|04-20-2015|sagittarius
492|You will find yourself in just the right place at just the right time to do something worthwhile today – that’s worthwhile for yourself and worthwhile for other people too. Make the most of it – it won’t always be this easy.|04-21-2015|sagittarius
493|Like it or not you will have to follow the rules today, because if you deviate from what others think is permissible you could get yourself in a whole load of trouble. Sometimes you have no choice but to toe the line.|04-22-2015|sagittarius
494|You have so much to do but time is limited, so don’t waste even a second on things that are not connected to your long-term ambitions. And don’t worry if you tread on a few toes over the next 24 hours – you can always apologize later.|04-23-2015|sagittarius
495|Whatever barrier may be in front of you it won’t be long before you find a way to break through. Strive to be strong, mentally and emotionally, and before you know it what you thought was an immovable obstacle will begin to shift. |04-24-2015|sagittarius
496|Don’t worry too much if you fall out with a partner or colleague over the next 48 hours as tension has been building up for a while and needs to be released. Come Monday morning you will be the best of friends again. |04-25-2015|sagittarius
497|If someone makes unreasonable demands of you this week you must be strong and let them know you have no intention of doing what they say. What can they do to force you? Absolutely nothing, so there is no need to be afraid. |04-26-2015|sagittarius
498|According to the planets you have been focusing on trivia and missing the big stuff. Your life is your own and you can do as you please, of course, but you will mentally kick yourself later if you look back and see what you might have achieved.|04-27-2015|sagittarius
499|If something you are working on does not seem to be making progress most likely it’s because you are trying too hard. You are at your best when you are relaxed, so slow down and calm down and you’ll master it soon.|04-28-2015|sagittarius
500|You will work extremely hard today and for the rest of the week, not for cash or fame but because you want to prove that a goal you set yourself a while back is possible to reach. If you gain in other ways too – that’s a bonus.|04-29-2015|sagittarius
501|A dispute of some kind will come to the boil over the next few days but in a way that’s good because all these negative feelings are not doing you any favors. Once the air has cleared you can move on again, together or on your own.|04-30-2015|sagittarius
502|Partners and loved ones will have plenty to say for themselves today and not all of it will be music to your ears, but if you are smart you will sit there and listen. Once they have let off steam things will quickly get back to normal.|05-01-2015|sagittarius
503|What you think is a problem is actually an opportunity in disguise. As Mercury, planet of the mind, opposes Saturn in your sign this weekend, you need to look beyond the obvious and see beneath the surface. Find out what is really going on. |05-02-2015|sagittarius
504|Monday’s full moon is likely to play havoc with your confidence but whatever it is that worries you is almost certainly of no real importance. Whatever your position in life, if you believe in yourself then anything, and everything, is possible. |05-03-2015|sagittarius
505|It may appear to others that you are not doing very much but just because you are not active on the outside does not mean you are not active on the inside. On the contrary, that Sagittarius brain of yours is bubbling with new ideas. |05-04-2015|sagittarius
506|Don’t tie yourself down to set aims and objectives over the next 24 hours because it is highly likely that things will change fast and you will have no choice but to change with them. All things are possible if you stay flexible.|05-05-2015|sagittarius
507|Go somewhere new and do something different today. The more adventurous you are and the further you travel from your home base the more fun you will have. You will make a new friend too – and maybe you will be more than just friends.|05-06-2015|sagittarius
508|Make sure that everything you do has a purpose today. Despite what you may think to the contrary you do not possess unlimited energy, so ration it carefully, especially on the work front where you are likely to be burdened with extra duties.|05-08-2015|sagittarius
509|Someone who does not share your optimistic way of looking at the world will give you a hard time over the next 48 hours, simply because they cannot stand to see you have fun. So, make it your business to have more fun than ever! |05-09-2015|sagittarius
510|You may not be your usual extrovert self today but even a Sagittarius needs to take things easy once in a while and according to the planets this is a great time to switch off and not worry too much about the world around you. |05-11-2015|sagittarius
511|You may not like a certain person very much but you are going to have to work with them and the sooner you accept that fact the sooner your business with each other will be finished and the sooner you can be on your way again.|05-12-2015|sagittarius
512|You feel there is nothing you cannot do. You feel that nothing is too much for you. That could be true but with Mars moving through your opposite sign you must take into account what other people want too. If not, you’ll create enemies.|05-13-2015|sagittarius
513|A problem you have been grappling with may be tough but there is a solution, so keep asking and keep searching and you will find what you are looking for in the end. What you eventually discover will surprise you – by how simple it is.|05-14-2015|sagittarius
514|Jupiter in the sympathetic sign of Leo means you will make your own decisions and take whatever risks you think are necessary over the next 24 hours. You won’t doubt for a moment that you are doing the right thing. And you are.|05-15-2015|sagittarius
515|Before you shake hands on some kind of deal make sure you know what it really entails. If you have any doubts then put off making a decision until early next week – then and only then will you know if it’s the right deal for you. |05-16-2015|sagittarius
516|You are in an extremely forceful mood at the moment and won’t take orders from anyone, no matter who may be handing them out. Try not to come across as too headstrong though or you could find yourself losing friends|05-17-2015|sagittarius
517|There is a task you have been putting off in the hope that it might go away but, of course, it won’t and today you will have no choice but to knuckle down and get it done. Once you get started you may actually enjoy it. |05-18-2015|sagittarius
518|Focus on the one or two things that really matter and let everything else look after itself. Like all Sags you are easily distracted but you can and you must concentrate on what is important today, whether or not it interests you personally.|05-19-2015|sagittarius
519|You are about to enter a more positive phase but that does not mean you can do as you please. The Sun’s entry into your opposite sign tomorrow is a boost but it is also an invitation to work more closely with partners and colleagues.|05-20-2015|sagittarius
520|Go out of your way to be nice to partners, loved ones and colleagues today because you will be depending on them a lot over the next few weeks. Do what you can to make life easier for them and you will get plenty in return.|05-21-2015|sagittarius
521|If you make a small change in one thing today the effects are likely to be much bigger than you expected, so act with care and, if in doubt, don’t act at all. Nothing is so important that it has to be dealt with immediately. |05-22-2015|sagittarius
522|Someone will give you a hard time for no good reason this weekend and you must stand up to them. It does not matter how big or how powerful they may be, you are the one who has right on your side. Make sure they know that.|05-23-2015|sagittarius
523|Be nice to everyone this week, even those people who don’t really deserve it. With the Sun moving through the partnership area of your chart now you will find that what you do for other people you also do for yourself. So do it well.|05-24-2015|sagittarius
524|Do you have the confidence and the know-how to step in and take control of a difficult situation? If so, by all means get involved. If not, stand back and let someone else take the leadership role. It does not have to be you every time.|05-25-2015|sagittarius
525|You don’t have to make apologies to someone you fell out with. Why should you when they are 100 per cent wrong and you are 100 per cent right? On the other hand maybe you should soften your tone. You still have to work with them.|05-26-2015|sagittarius
