0|You’re not the sort to play safe and even if you have been a bit more cautious than usual in recent weeks you will more than make up for it over the next few days. Plan your new adventure today and start working on it tomorrow.|12-01-2013|pisces
1|There is no such thing as something for nothing and if you do not quite believe that now you will believe it by the end of the day. If you lose something valuable accept it as the price you must pay to learn this important lesson.|12-02-2013|pisces
2|As the new moon falls in one of the more adventurous areas of your chart you will take the kind of risk you might usually steer clear of. No doubt it will surprise a few people, including yourself, when it pays off handsomely.|12-03-2013|pisces
3|You will hear something amazing today but can you believe it? If it sounds too good to be true then it might be wise to check it out. Commit too soon and you could find you have signed up for something that does you no good.|12-04-2013|pisces
4|A friend or colleague you have not seen for a while will come back into your life today, tomorrow of over the weekend and you will be hugely pleased. This time, when you say farewell, promise to stay in touch – and mean it. |12-05-2013|pisces
5|You may be a nice guy by nature but most likely you will refuse to come to the rescue of someone who is in distress today. It may seem heartless but you know it’s for the best – it’s the only way they are going to learn.|12-06-2013|pisces
6|Someone will give you a tough time this weekend and although you know you don’t deserve it you also know there is no point complaining. Do what they expect of you and, if at all possible, do it with a smile on your face.|12-07-2013|pisces
7|You will be restless this coming week, without knowing why. Get out and about by all means but don’t wander too far from home or you may have trouble getting back again. Wherever you go, stay in touch with loved ones. |12-08-2013|pisces
8|You may be open and honest by nature but is letting any one and everyone know what you are thinking such a good idea? Some things are best kept to yourself, especially things that rivals and opponents may be able to make use of.|12-09-2013|pisces
9|You must avoid wishful thinking today. Cosmic activity in areas of your chart that deal with self-deception could lead you to make some silly mistakes. Reality is what it is – there is no need to embellish it or wish it were something different.|12-10-2013|pisces
10|If you have not made as much progress as you would have liked on a project of some kind don’t worry – and certainly don’t work even harder. Maybe in future you should set yourself targets you know you will be able to reach.|12-11-2013|pisces
11|You may think you have to tear everything down and start again from scratch but it’s really not necessary. There is precious little wrong with your life as it is and a few minor changes here and there is all that is required.|12-12-2013|pisces
12|A decision you made a long time ago now doesn’t seem like such a great idea but that’s too bad because you are stuck with it. Make the best of the situation and promise yourself that you won’t be so hasty in future.|12-13-2013|pisces
13|If someone you have to deal with on a day-to-day basis gets a bit bossy this weekend let them know you will not be pushed around. Others will only try to get away with what they think they can get away with. Make that nothing!|12-14-2013|pisces
14|If you are on the move over the next few days try to steer clear of people who upset you emotionally. Once you give in to negative emotions it will all start going wrong and you’ll end up miles from where you want to be.|12-15-2013|pisces
15|Family and financial problems can easily be resolved over the next seven days, but you must not keep putting them off. If you have to say something unpleasant the quicker you get it over with the less it will hurt – for both of you|12-16-2013|pisces
16|There are times when it is right to back down but this isn’t one of them. If you find yourself under attack today you must stand up and fight back. Don’t be intimidated by those who make lots of noise. It’s mainly for show.|12-17-2013|pisces
17|You will get exactly what you deserve today: no more and no less. If the rewards are good don’t doubt that you have earned them; and if the rewards are not so good then buck up your ideas and aim to do better next time.|12-18-2013|pisces
18|You may have lots of big ideas in your mind but are you ever going to get around to turning them into something useful, something that makes a difference both to yourself and to others? Talk is cheap – it’s actions that count.|12-19-2013|pisces
19|A clash of opposing viewpoints is likely on the work front today, and because you need to get along with both sides you must stay neutral. The best approach is to treat it all as a bit of a joke, because that’s exactly what it is.|12-20-2013|pisces
20|The Sun crosses the midheaven angle of your chart today, giving you the authority you have been lacking in recent weeks. Make the most of this change to win employers and other authority figures round to your way of thinking.|12-21-2013|pisces
21|Go out of your way to be pleasant to everyone you meet, even to those who are anything but pleasant to you. The more you smile and act as if the world is your friend the more the celestial powers that be will reward you.|12-22-2013|pisces
22|If you are happy with the way your career is going then don’t change a thing. If, however, you think you should be making more of your talents and moving up the ladder of success a good deal faster, do something about it – now!|12-23-2013|pisces
23|Something you have been working on for a long time will bear fruit today. Others may say you’ve been lucky but the fact is you have labored long and hard to get this far and deserve the good things now coming your way. |12-24-2013|pisces
24|Don’t bother trying to hide your feelings today because with your ruler Mars at odds with unpredictable Uranus they are sure to reveal themselves in some way, maybe explosively. Let others know what is annoying you – and why.|12-25-2013|pisces
25|You are on the threshold of a spectacular breakthrough. Which only goes to show that when you focus on a goal and follow up on it consistently you CAN be a success. But don’t get too full of yourself or fate may burst your bubble.|12-26-2013|pisces
26|Flattery will get you everywhere today, especially when dealing with people in authority. You can easily persuade them to give you what you want – but don’t forget it works both ways: they may want something from you in return.|12-27-2013|pisces
27|Patch up any partnership disputes you may be having because current aspects will not only make joint endeavors fun but will make them profitable too. Why argue when you could be laughing and making lots of money together?|12-28-2013|pisces
28|A new moon in the career area of your chart means it is time to make a decision about your future. Don’t forget though that the moon is an emotional influence. Make sure you know all the facts and are thinking straight before you move ahead.|12-29-2013|pisces
29|No matter how many times you may have fallen short in the past you will measure up now. Push yourself hard this week and don’t give up hope just because you experience one or two setbacks. That breakthrough you seek is very close.|12-30-2013|pisces
30|Authority figures may be difficult to get along with today, but you can make things easier for yourself by refusing to get involved in disputes that serve no purpose. If you can, steer clear of people who rub you up the wrong way. |12-31-2013|pisces
31|If you need to ask a favor of someone in a position of authority now is the time to speak up. Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart is so good at the moment they will grant you (almost) anything and everything you desire.|01-01-2014|pisces
32|No matter how outrageous your ideas may seem to some people, you must trust your instincts and follow up on them. Allow your inner voice to guide you, and don’t be in the least bit surprised when it all works out perfectly.|01-03-2014|pisces
33|If your reputation is important to you, then be careful what you say and do this weekend because with Jupiter, planet of excess, at odds with the Sun you could go too far and turn people against you. Make an effort to always be moderate.|01-04-2014|pisces
34|What you gain over the coming week will more than make up for what you have lost, so be of good cheer. Sometimes something has to go out of your life before something new can come in and that seems to be the case now.|01-06-2014|pisces
35|Try to avoid confrontation today because almost certainly you will come off second best. If possible, go off and be by yourself for a while: You will return to the fray refreshed physically and mentally and with lots of great new ideas. |01-07-2014|pisces
36|This is one of those days when you would rather be anywhere than where you are supposed to be. If you can find a legitimate way out of the situation then go for it, but if you just fail to turn up you could create a powerful enemy.|01-08-2014|pisces
37|You will gain more by doing less today. Either cut back on your workload or get friends and colleagues to help you out. Better still, do both and put your feet up. There’s no cosmic law that says you have to do anything at all.|01-09-2014|pisces
38|There are so many ambitions you want to pursue and so many goals you want to reach, but not even an Aries can do everything at once. Sit yourself down and decide what is the number one thing that needs to be done – then do it.|01-10-2014|pisces
39||01-11-2014|pisces
40|Tell people the truth as you see it, even if it means upsetting someone you respect or endangering your standing with friends and colleagues. Even the smallest of lies must be avoided over the next seven days – unless you enjoy trouble.|01-12-2014|pisces
41|No matter how many times you have fallen short in the past you will succeed this week. The Sun remains in the most ambitious area of your chart until the 20th, so make the most of it – show the world what a star you really are.|01-13-2014|pisces
42|Take time out of your busy schedule to sit down and think about what it is you are doing and where it is you are going. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your career. Are you doing what you dreamed you’d be doing?|01-14-2014|pisces
43|The full moon’s influence will pull your emotions first one way then the other over the next 48 hours. Because of that the safest course of action by far is to ignore them completely and act only on what your head tells you.|01-15-2014|pisces
44|Be honest with friends and colleagues today, even if what you have to tell them is not what they want to hear. Having said which, maybe what you think is bad news is nothing of the kind – maybe from their point of view it’s good.|01-16-2014|pisces
45|Your mind will be moving fast today and over the weekend as you look for ways to make your ideas pay. But don’t make any major decisions until after the Sun changes signs on the 20th. Only then will the way forward be clear.|01-17-2014|pisces
46|A few days from now you could find yourself moving in a new direction, with new ambitions and maybe even a new set of friends. This weekend though you are advised to sit tight and spend some quality time with your loved ones.|01-18-2014|pisces
47|Don’t rush into anything over the next few days but be ready to act decisively when the opportunity you have been waiting for finally arrives. Also, make a point of working more closely with people who share your ideals.|01-19-2014|pisces
48|Whatever you happen to be working on now you will get it done quicker and better if you get other people involved. But they must be involved as equals. It may be your vision, your baby, but don’t let your ego get in the way of success.|01-20-2014|pisces
49|Even if you prefer to walk alone it will pay you to get more involved in group activities over the next few days. Friends and social contacts will bring you luck and make life more enjoyable, so get out there and have some fun.|01-21-2014|pisces
50|You may not agree with what you hear today but you must let others have their say. Free speech is worth fighting for, so if someone tries to shout down a dissenting opinion make it your business to defend their right to be different.|01-22-2014|pisces
51|Is what you are planning really such a good idea? Could it be that you have overestimated your abilities? Don’t worry. The planets indicate you have what it takes and once you get moving all your doubt will disappear. So get moving!|01-23-2014|pisces
52|There is no point being angry about what you have to leave behind. The planets are pointing you in a new direction and urging you to take that first brave step into the unknown. What are you waiting for? Aries is supposed to be adventurous!|01-24-2014|pisces
53|You will get a much needed rest this weekend from a problem that has been causing you sleepless nights but it won’t go away completely. A personality conflict is still a major issue and sooner or later will have to be dealt with.|01-25-2014|pisces
54|Get involved in something that is bigger than yourself, such as a social movement or charitable enterprise. No matter how dynamic an Aries you may be you cannot change the world alone, but you can make a difference working with others.|01-26-2014|pisces
55|You will find it easier to be assertive this week but that does not mean you can order people around for the fun of it. Try to work harmoniously with those who share your aims and ambitions – there are plenty of them out there in the world.|01-27-2014|pisces
56|Don’t get discouraged if something you attempt does not work out the way you expected it to – it is still good practice and may even take you in a profitable new direction, one you may not otherwise have thought of. You’re making progress.|01-28-2014|pisces
57|You may fantasize about running away and starting again from scratch some place new, but deep down you know it isn’t going to happen. Focus on making the best of where you are and what you have got — and that’s plenty.|01-29-2014|pisces
58|This will be a thoroughly enjoyable day and it will be more enjoyable still if you don’t waste time worrying what other people might think about what you are doing – or, more to the point, who you are doing it with!|01-30-2014|pisces
59|You may prefer to deal with facts and figures but there are times when you must take what you are told on trust, and this is one of them. Those you work alongside may be difficult at times but they are still very much on your side.|01-31-2014|pisces
60|Something you thought was going to be difficult will be easy, and something you thought was going to be easy will be difficult. Take it all in your stride. Life is not about events as such but about what you choose to make of them.|02-01-2014|pisces
61|The cosmos will give your confidence a boost this week and make all things seem possible. Don’t listen to those who say you should be patient and cautious. If you can think of something you should get on and do it. Make it happen.|02-03-2014|pisces
62|You are in a domineering mood at the moment and won’t hesitate to tell others how to do things. But anyone who tries to tell you will most likely wish they had kept quiet. They should do as you say, not as you do!|02-04-2014|pisces
63|You may find it hard to predict what others are going to do next, but there is no need to keep looking over your shoulder. Despite one or two minor setbacks today, the rest of the week will be much to your liking — so enjoy. |02-05-2014|pisces
64|Something will happen today that takes you by surprise but if you stand back from the situation and look at it in an objective light you will see it had to occur. Chances are that a few weeks from now you will be so glad it happened.|02-06-2014|pisces
65|If you could have three wishes what would they be? Focus on what you desire more than anything and there is a very good chance you will get it. Your mind is a powerful tool and if you use it to make a request the universe will respond.|02-07-2014|pisces
66|Looking back on the past seven days, you will be feeling quietly pleased with yourself, not least for having resisted the temptation to get uptight about issues that are of no real importance. Let others rant and rage. For you the weekend is about relaxing.|02-08-2014|pisces
67|Just because someone else is behaving badly or playing the fool does not mean you have to follow their example. This is going to be an important week, especially for relationships, so don’t go annoying people just for the fun of it.|02-10-2014|pisces
68|No matter how strong your beliefs and opinions may be, what happens today and tomorrow will make you question them. That’s good. Every now and again you need to stand back and remind yourself what it’s all about and what it’s all for. |02-11-2014|pisces
69|Put a name to your fears and do something about them. Everyone expects you to be happy-go-lucky and most of the time you are, but something has been worrying you beyond belief in recent weeks. It’s time to get over it.|02-12-2014|pisces
70|Secrecy may not come naturally to you but the less you reveal about yourself the better. You need to be a bit more mysterious, especially on the work front. Keep both colleagues and rivals at arm’s length and don’t forget that knowledge is power.|02-13-2014|pisces
71|Think twice before speaking your mind. Although today’s full moon takes place in your fellow Fire sign of Aries you could still get emotional and say things you later regret, so bite your tongue and keep your feelings to yourself – for now.|02-14-2014|pisces
72|Even if you risk hurting a loved one’s feelings you must tell them the truth about the situation they have got themselves into. Be as tactful as you can but make sure they can see they need to change their ways – and fast.|02-15-2014|pisces
73|Once the Sun changes signs tomorrow you will be less concerned about what’s taking place in the world at large and more concerned about what’s going on inside your head. It’s good to think and you’ll be doing plenty over the next few days.|02-17-2014|pisces
74|Don’t agree to something just because you cannot be bothered to argue. If you take the easy way out now you will have major problems later on when loved ones and work colleagues hold you to your promises. Best not to make them in the first place.|02-18-2014|pisces
75|You will receive advice from all directions today, making it difficult to work out who is and who is not talking sense. Maybe you should shut yourself away for an hour or two and come to your own conclusions. Your inner voice knows best. |02-19-2014|pisces
76|There are a lot of things you need to consider, things that may be of benefit to you in the not too distant future, so don’t waste your time socializing when you should be thinking. Come the weekend you’ll have earned the right to party.|02-20-2014|pisces
77|Even if you are the kind of Aries who loves surprises what happens today won’t necessarily meet with your approval, especially if the joke is on you. Think of all the times when you’ve been the prankster and don’t be afraid to laugh at yourself.|02-21-2014|pisces
78|There is no such thing as coincidence and the more certain events seem to keep happening the more suspicious you should be. Fortunately you are not as gullible as some people want to believe, so it’s unlikely you will be deceived.|02-22-2014|pisces
79|No matter what plans you may have made for the coming week you must set aside time to be by yourself and think about the direction your life is heading. And if you come to the conclusion that it isn’t heading anywhere then do something about it.|02-23-2014|pisces
80|Although you should be feeling good about yourself as the new week begins you are advised not to go over the top in any way or the consequences could be painful. Also, ask yourself some questions about the direction your life is heading.|02-24-2014|pisces
81|There are a number of things you need to get rid of, things that are holding you back and stopping you from realizing your full potential. You know what they are and you know they must go. Now is the time to draw a line on the past.|02-25-2014|pisces
82|You may be impatient to see progress being made but if you take a risk too many you could take a rather big step in the wrong direction. If you do there is no point rebuking yourself – it’s just one of those things that happens sometimes.|02-26-2014|pisces
83|It won’t be long before your mind is back in the groove – and your tongue will be pretty sharp as well. You will have a lot to say for yourself today but be careful that you don’t give away secrets to people who may be your rivals.|02-27-2014|pisces
84|As mind planet Mercury moves in your favor again today your attitude will change for the better and you will be more upbeat about your hopes and wishes. Anything is possible if you want it enough – so want it enough and be amazing!|02-28-2014|pisces
85|Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your sky will help you see through the web of deceit that certain people have built to keep you from the truth. But don’t go to the other extreme and refuse to trust anyone about anything.|03-01-2014|pisces
86|You don’t need to talk yourself up – important people are well aware of what you are capable of. You won’t have to try too hard to make an impression over the next seven days. In fact you won’t have to try too hard at anything.|03-02-2014|pisces
87|The Sun links with power planet Pluto today, so it’s unlikely you will be in the mood to stay home and bake cookies. There is a world out there waiting to be conquered and you have both the talent and the ambition to be Number One.|03-03-2014|pisces
88|Not everyone shares your principles and beliefs, so don’t take it as a personal affront if others disagree with you today – which they will. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, that’s what makes the world such an interesting place.|03-04-2014|pisces
89|Today’s cosmic set-up is fortunate in the extreme, but only if you are prepared to get out into the world, put yourself about and shake a few hands. You know the old saying: it’s not so much what you know that matters as who you know.|03-05-2014|pisces
90|Family matters of one sort or another will take up most of your time today but don’t think that means you cannot have fun. On the contrary, loved ones are hoping you will suggest some kind of trip or adventure you can all enjoy together.|03-06-2014|pisces
91|Don’t be afraid to disagree with someone in a position of authority. You respect the fact that they outrank you but you also know that if you do as they say you will regret it. Aries is the first sign of the zodiac – so put your needs first.|03-07-2014|pisces
92|Stick to your principles this weekend. Don’t back off to keep the peace or for the sake of an easy life. The planets warn if you compromise on one thing your rivals will see it as a sign of weakness and pressure you into further concessions.|03-08-2014|pisces
93|You have a wonderful future but the Sun in your next door neighbor sign of Pisces is making you fear the worst, and that’s not good. Keep telling yourself that you deserve the best and that the best will happen – and very soon it will.|03-09-2014|pisces
94|The planets are encouraging you to break out of a rut and live closer to the edge for a while. Security is all very well but an Aries needs excitement too, so do something out of the ordinary this week, something that gets you noticed.|03-10-2014|pisces
95|A relationship that has been okay in the past will turn difficult today. There may be no apparent reason why it has suddenly gone sour but don’t make an issue of it. Most likely it is just a passing phase, so stay calm and keep smiling.|03-11-2014|pisces
96|The Sun in Pisces at this time of year can make you rather emotional and you will certainly find it hard to hide your feelings today. But why would you want to? Honesty is essential in all situations, especially where loved ones are concerned.|03-12-2014|pisces
97|The future is not bleak, no matter what some pessimists say. In fact it is exceedingly bright and you are in the right place at the right time to take advantage of all the good things that will be coming. Keep your eyes and ears open.|03-13-2014|pisces
98|Because Mars, your ruler, is on good form today something will happen that has you jumping for joy. By all means make plans for your professional future but leave yourself some wiggle room in case you want to change your mind later.|03-14-2014|pisces
99|Don’t give others the impression that you agree with them when, if anything, you think they are completely and utterly wrong. The full moon means it’s best if they know right from the start what you really think and feel.|03-15-2014|pisces
100|Don’t worry if you have not been getting the support and encouragement you need from partners and loved ones and work colleagues. Once the Sun moves into your birth sign on Thursday you won’t require anyone’s help but your own.|03-16-2014|pisces
101|The more you dwell on a matter that troubles you the more you will worry about it, so pull your mind away from the issue and focus on what makes you feel good. There are still no end of things you have to be thankful for.|03-17-2014|pisces
102|Put your heart and soul into what you are working on. No matter how much natural talent you may have and no matter how good you may be in a technical sense what makes you stand out from the crowd is your enthusiasm.|03-18-2014|pisces
103|If you make a wish over the next two or three days it may well come true. With the Sun moving into your birth sign tomorrow, marking the start of a new solar year, you are likely to get whatever you ask for – well, mostly.|03-19-2014|pisces
104|The Sun moves into your sign today, so there can be no more excuses. You know what you want, you know how to get it and you know that if you make a genuine effort nothing can stop you. The world is yours to command and enjoy.|03-20-2014|pisces
105|Don’t waste time on regrets or remorse. Don’t look back when you should be looking forward. This is your time of year and if you are positive and dynamic you will enjoy the kind of progress that makes yesterday’s doubts and failures irrelevant.|03-21-2014|pisces
106|You will be in a thoughtful frame of mind this weekend and that’s good. Try to resist the temptation to look for easy solutions to what are really quite complex problems. Most complex of all, of course, are other people’s emotions.|03-22-2014|pisces
107|If your life is in a bit of a rut at the moment the best way to cheer yourself up is to get dreaming. Jupiter makes it easy for you to conjure up all sorts of mental pictures of what your future could be like – and they’re all fabulous!|03-23-2014|pisces
108|If you need assistance over the next few days you must ask for it. There is nothing heroic about keeping your pain to yourself. By all means be independent but why suffer when friends and family are ready and willing to help you?|03-24-2014|pisces
109|When was the last time you set yourself new targets? Most likely you’ve been happy to drift along and take things as they come but now you need to be more demanding of yourself. What would you do if you knew success was guaranteed? So do it.|03-25-2014|pisces
110|If you are as smart as you think you are you will pay attention to what loved ones and friends say you should be doing. They can see what you cannot: that you could and should be using the talents you were born with to make the world a better place.|03-26-2014|pisces
111|Hopefully you will see solutions today where before you saw only problems. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to money matters and business issues that involve other people. Together you can make a profit and have fun.|03-27-2014|pisces
112|You will make your presence felt today, especially on the work front where power planet Pluto encourages you to believe you are worthy of bigger and better things. You are entitled to be treated with respect – and you will make sure you get it.|03-28-2014|pisces
113|Love planet Venus is strong on your birthday, so affairs of the heart will be even more important than usual this year. But don’t think it’s just about romance and having fun – if you commit to a relationship it helps if you are on the same intellectual wavelength too.|03-29-2014|pisces
114|A new moon on your birthday will inspire you to cut ties that hold you back and march on confidently to a brighter and more bountiful future. Be honest with yourself about who you are and what it is you want most out of life – then go out and get it. |03-30-2014|pisces
115|You must not let your emotions get the better of you over the coming year. You may be tempted to cut ties that only seem to bring you pain but if you give it time you will find that things improve. Ultimately, life is only as tough as you choose to make it.|03-31-2014|pisces
116|The more others try to make you change your mind about something the more you must dig in your heels and refuse to be moved. You know what is right and what is wrong, so make your own decision and stick to it.|04-01-2014|pisces
117|You have a talent for surprising people and with the Sun linked to Uranus, planet of the unexpected, in your sign today you will go out of your way to shock. Just be careful you don’t upset those on whom your security depends.|04-02-2014|pisces
118|See to it that you are properly rewarded for your efforts, especially on the work front where others may try to give you less than you deserve. You don’t have to be aggressive about it but make sure you get what you are worth.|04-03-2014|pisces
119|You seem to be feeling a bit vulnerable but there really is no need. What happens over the next few days will lift your spirits and also remind you that, even when things do go a little bit wrong, it’s not the end of the world.|04-04-2014|pisces
120|You are torn between two very different ways of looking at the world. On the one hand you think human nature is basically negative but on the other you want to see an essential goodness is all living things. Choose the latter. Your choice will make it true.|04-05-2014|pisces
121|Push your luck this week and believe all things are possible. But bear in mind too that, while you may be doing well, not everyone is as fortunate as you, so try not to make a big show of your successes – it may cause unnecessary resentment.|04-06-2014|pisces
122|You are about to embark on one of the best times of the year for ideas and communication. Are you ready? Anything of a creative or artistic nature will go well for you over the next few days. Be good. No, be great.|04-07-2014|pisces
123|It’s not always easy to get along with other people and today’s Sun-Mars aspect will in some way or other challenge you to be more accepting. Don’t forget too that from other people’s point of view you are often the one making too much noise.|04-08-2014|pisces
124|If you want a straight answer to a simple question you may be disappointed – others are so evasive today. Maybe they have something to hide but more likely their thoughts are simply all over the place. Not everyone is as organized as you.|04-09-2014|pisces
125|Take extra care when dealing with anything of a legal nature and make sure you get promises in writing. No matter how much you may trust certain people you cannot know what mental, emotional or financial pressures they are under, so don’t take chances.|04-10-2014|pisces
126|The influence of Neptune, planet of deception, in your chart warns you could give away too much information about yourself. Be generous with your time and, if you can afford it, with your money too but keep your secrets to yourself.|04-11-2014|pisces
127|Some people may get emotional this weekend but you will remain cool, calm and collected. One particular individual could really get on your nerves but the best way to deal with them is to take yourself off some place where they cannot follow.|04-12-2014|pisces
128|A week from now the Sun will leave your birth sign and when it does you will have to get serious about your cash flow situation. It won’t be so painful if you accept that you are spending too much and start making savings right now.|04-13-2014|pisces
129|Mind planet Mercury links with Uranus, planet of genius, on your birthday this year, so there is every chance you will come up with some brilliant ideas. Don’t limit yourself to old ways of thinking – be brave and ask the questions everyone else tries to avoid.|04-14-2014|pisces
130|There seems to be a barrier of some kind between you and other people, no doubt caused by today’s lunar eclipse in your opposite sign. Don’t worry. The cosmic tide will turn. It won’t be long before you are back on the same wavelength.|04-15-2014|pisces
131|You will experience plenty of ups and downs over the coming 12 months but even the downs will have a positive side, so be happy and strive to see the good in each and every situation you encounter – and each and every person who comes into your life.|04-16-2014|pisces
132|The moon’s eclipse of Saturn on your birthday suggests you need to reconsider your relationship to money and possessions. Yes, of course, it’s nice to be financially secure but are you emotionally secure too? If not, what can you do to change that?|04-17-2014|pisces
133|You want to strike out on your own. You want to do something that you alone can take credit for. That’s fine but you will get further faster if you learn from the mistakes of those who have been there before you. Do your homework – and be brilliant!|04-18-2014|pisces
134|If you have got into the habit of thinking that nothing will ever go wrong again then what happens this weekend will set you straight. But there is still a large luck factor working in your favor, so don’t let events dent your confidence too much.|04-19-2014|pisces
135|Be careful how much you spend over the next few days because if you go over the top you are likely to regret it. The planets warn you may not be as well off as you thought you were – and there are always bills to pay.|04-20-2014|pisces
136|Major planets are at loggerheads as the new week begins and you too will find it hard to get along with certain people. The important thing is that you don’t take any of it too seriously, because like all such situations it will pass with time.|04-21-2014|pisces
137|You will be somewhat impatient today, especially on the work front where you can’t understand why some people are unable to keep up with you mentally or physically. Not everyone shares your energy or enthusiasm, so calm down and make allowances.|04-22-2014|pisces
138|You know what it is that you want so now it’s just about how you are going to get it. If your plans are being held back by a lack of cash what happens today and tomorrow will help – but ultimately the effort must come from you.|04-23-2014|pisces
139|Some things are worth worrying about and some things are not – do you know which is which? Chances are material things such as money and possessions won’t mean as much to you over the next 24 hours as they usually do, and that’s good.|04-24-2014|pisces
140|Try not to be too serious about life today. There’s a time to ponder the big questions but this isn’t it. The planets urge you to be practical and to focus on what is in front of you. Also, stay alert for new opportunities.|04-25-2014|pisces
141|A new money-making venture will excite you this weekend but before you get carried away and start thinking you are going to be rich be warned that even if you do make your fortune it may cost you in other ways. Relationships are important too.|04-26-2014|pisces
142|If you honestly believe that certain people are trying to get rich at your expense then you must make it clear to them that the consequences won’t be pretty. Hopefully they will see sense and give you your fair share. If not…|04-27-2014|pisces
143|Don’t worry if your finances have not been too healthy of late because you will find ways to replace what you have lost or spent. Mind planet Mercury will also help you get your head around ideas which at other times might confuse you.|04-28-2014|pisces
144|You will be quick off the mark both physically and mentally today, especially if you see a chance to make some money. Both the solar eclipse and mind planet Mercury will help you make quick decisions, then follow them up with speedy action.|04-29-2014|pisces
145|You have taken on a lot of new tasks in recent weeks and could probably do with some help. Others will come to your assistance and share the load if you ask them but you must make it worth their while. What’s in it for them?|05-01-2014|pisces
146|There will be a great many claims on your time and your energy today, so be selective in what you agree to do or you may exhaust yourself. You should know by now that it’s better to do one job really well than ten jobs poorly.|05-02-2014|pisces
147|What you need to remember this weekend is that you have nothing to prove, either to yourself or to other people. Make sure that what you agree to do is what you want to do and not what others have persuaded you to do.|05-03-2014|pisces
148|You can learn a lot over the next seven days, simply by listening to what other people have to tell you. You will also be pleasantly surprised by some of the things you discover. There is always something new to learn, even for an Aries|05-04-2014|pisces
149|Listen to what a friend has to tell you and be quick to act on their advice. Even if what they say is not what you were hoping to hear there is a lot of wisdom in their words, not least because they can see what you currently cannot.|05-05-2014|pisces
150|You will get what you desire today but you will have to pay a price for it. The planets will reward you for all the hard work you have done but they will also ask you to sacrifice something you may not want to give up.|05-06-2014|pisces
151|Keep your eyes and ears open today because if you don’t you could miss out on a great opportunity to have fun. With Mercury moving strongly in your favor your mind will be sharp and strong, giving you a major advantage over your rivals.|05-07-2014|pisces
152|You are not the kind to turn away someone who is down on their luck, but watch out you don’t get conned by a sob story today. Sadly not everyone is as honest as you, so check the facts before even thinking of parting with cash.|05-08-2014|pisces
153|You may think you know what motivates someone but the planets warn you have got it all wrong, and that could be dangerous. Both in your personal life and at work you are advised not to jump to conclusions today – or any day.|05-09-2014|pisces
154|The Sun links with Saturn this weekend and you should take that as a sign that it’s time to slow down a bit. Not even an Aries can continue at the pace you have set yourself, so ease off and get your breath back.|05-10-2014|pisces
155||05-11-2014|pisces
156|Rivals seem to know what you are doing, even when you are not sure what you are doing yourself – which puts you at a disadvantage. Either be a bit more secretive or find ways to tap in more effectively to what’s going on around you.|05-12-2014|pisces
157|You have started many new things in recent weeks but you will soon have to choose which one or two projects you are going to focus on. Remember, quality always counts for more than quantity, so there’s no point trying to do it all.|05-13-2014|pisces
158|Today’s full moon warns that, where money and possessions are concerned, nothing is quite what it seems. For that reason alone it would be wise to think twice before signing up to anything you don’t have complete personal control over.|05-14-2014|pisces
159|People respond better to charm than to threats or coercion, so use the power of Venus in your sign to work your way around their defenses. You need to know when to exert pressure and when to stand back and let things happen.|05-15-2014|pisces
160|Someone you think you can trust may try to trick you today, so be on your guard. It’s usually when you feel most relaxed and secure that you are most likely to be cheated, so make sure you know what’s going on around you.|05-16-2014|pisces
161|Mars in your opposite sign makes you a bit too rough and ready for some people’s tastes, so be careful you don’t make the wrong impression, especially when dealing with people in positions of power. You CAN do nice – if you try.|05-17-2014|pisces
162|As the Sun moves into the most open and outgoing area of your chart this week you will have no trouble at all being sociable. Not that you had much trouble before, but as from the 21st you will be a real party animal.|05-18-2014|pisces
163|Confront what you fear the most and it won’t ever scare you again. Few things in life are worth getting too worked up about, so face up to what has been worrying you and see it for what it really is: an illusion you can safely ignore.|05-19-2014|pisces
164|Don’t worry if you find it hard to put your feelings into words – your body language will tell partners and loved ones all they need to know. And with Mars, your ruler, moving in your favor again they’ll get to know plenty!|05-20-2014|pisces
165|There are a lot of things you have wanted to say but held back because you did not want to upset or annoy people. Now the Sun is changing signs you have no option but to speak up. If you don’t it will be you who suffers.|05-21-2014|pisces
166|You will jump right in and get things done today. Your mind is working fast and your body isn’t far behind it, so do what feels right and do it magnificently. You will surprise a few people, including yourself, by what you achieve.|05-22-2014|pisces
167|Money issues have taken center stage for some time but now the Sun has changed signs you should be a bit more relaxed about what you own and what you earn. If your social life has suffered of late make up for it today.|05-23-2014|pisces
168|In some way or other you will have to make sacrifices this weekend but the universe will balance things out by rewarding you in other ways, so don’t be afraid to make changes. Life is an adventure or it is nothing.|05-24-2014|pisces
169|Sometimes you can be overly suspicious but this week you will go right the other way and trust just about everyone. In return, others will go out of their way to smooth your path and help you realize your most cherished ambitions.|05-25-2014|pisces
170|This could be and should be one of the most enjoyable times of the year but if you want it to be really special you need to be more optimistic. A lot will depend on your state of mind – as it’s your mind that creates your reality.|05-26-2014|pisces
171|There is no point trying to predict what will happen over the next two or three days because there are so many ways the various issues in your life can play themselves out. Just stay calm and be ready to act when big events happen.|05-27-2014|pisces
172|You can be as carefree as you please over the next 24 hours – no one will mind in the slightest. Not that you care what other people think but it’s nice to be in a position where you can have fun without being called irresponsible.|05-28-2014|pisces
173|If you find yourself losing interest in what you are doing today that’s a sure sign you are doing the wrong thing. A change of scene will help but in the long-term you may have to change your lifetime ambitions. A major turning point approaches.|05-29-2014|pisces
174|Relationships seem to be taking on a more aggressive edge, due to the presence of Mars in your opposite sign. Keep reminding yourself that life is not a battle and that people are not the enemy. Compromise is better than confrontation.|05-30-2014|pisces
175|You don’t want to let others make decisions for you this weekend but you do want them to do more of the work and relieve you of some of the strain. Fortunately Mars, your ruler, is on super form, so you’ll have no trouble giving orders!|05-31-2014|pisces
176|The facts may be all on your side at the moment but if you are wise you won’t shout about it too loudly. If you do you may cause some resentment and could even turn a few of your friends against you. Know when to stay quiet.|06-01-2014|pisces
177|By all means listen to what friends and relatives tell you but don’t think for a moment you have to follow their advice. Deep down you already know what needs to be done, so why not just pluck up the courage and get on and do it?|06-02-2014|pisces
178|Give your brain a rest. Focus only on things that bring a smile to your face. The way you choose to think about life will determine how enjoyable, or how difficult, it is going to be. Positive thoughts always bring positive results.|06-03-2014|pisces
179|Although material matters may be taking up a great deal of your time that does not mean you should focus on them to the exclusion of everything else. Your task today is to balance your pursuit of success with something of a more spiritual nature.|06-04-2014|pisces
180|What happens today may convince you that you have allowed yourself to be lulled into a false sense of security but even if it’s true it is really no big deal. You’re smart enough and tough enough to handle whatever fate sends your way.|06-05-2014|pisces
181|You won’t take kindly to others telling you what to do. Anyone who thinks they can order you around is going to find that you are in no mood to sit back and take it. There should be only one person calling the shots now – and that’s you.|06-06-2014|pisces
182|You seem to be a bit jumpy. Why is that? Whatever the reason the planets indicate there is nothing to fear, either at home or at work, so stop fretting. Also, stop beating yourself up about things that happened in the dim and distant past.|06-07-2014|pisces
183|You are doing things for other people which they really should be doing for themselves. At some stage over the coming week, most likely in the run-up to the full moon on the 13th, you will have to cut back on your commitments somewhat.|06-08-2014|pisces
184|Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart inclines you to believe that everyone is out to get you, that there are enemies lurking behind every door. Maybe there are, but more likely your imagination is playing tricks on you.|06-09-2014|pisces
185|Your confidence is high at the moment but today’s lunar eclipse of Saturn warns it may be only skin deep. Some kind of setback could easily send you into a tailspin over the next 24 hours, so strive to keep a sense of perspective.|06-10-2014|pisces
186|If you have a crush on someone then let them know. There is, of course, no guarantee that they will return your feelings but even if they do not they will be flattered by your interest. One way or the other you’ll know where you stand.|06-11-2014|pisces
187|You may be doing well financially but there is a danger now you will take one risk too many and undo much of the good work you have put together in recent weeks. Self-belief is a wonderful thing but too much can be self-defeating.|06-12-2014|pisces
188|Everyone is entitled to their opinion, so don’t get uptight if someone says something you disagree with. Stay calm, tell your side of the story and then listen to theirs – and don’t be surprised if what they say makes a lot of sense.|06-13-2014|pisces
189|There are two ways things can go this weekend: either you can put aside your differences with someone and work together towards a common goal or you can waste your time and energy fighting each other for no real reason. Over to you.|06-14-2014|pisces
190|Something you said a while back may return to haunt you over the next few days but there’s not much you can do about it. Go with the flow and accept that actions always have consequences. Next time you won’t be quite so outspoken.|06-15-2014|pisces
191|The Sun remains in the communications area of your chart only until the 21st, so if there are things you need to say it might be best to say them now. Avoid confusion by making sure your words are simple and to the point.|06-16-2014|pisces
192|You may be a bit moody today for no apparent reason. Yes, okay, certain things have not worked out the way you anticipated but it’s hardly the end of the world, so keep things in perspective and do whatever it takes to cheer yourself up.|06-17-2014|pisces
193|You cannot control your destiny every minute of every day, so let go and let fate take its course. Some rather unsettling things are likely to happen over the next few days, but that does not mean they will be bad for you.|06-18-2014|pisces
194|Everyone thinks you’re a star – so why are you being so negative about your prospects? Step outside yourself today and see how you look through other people’s eyes. You may not be perfect – who is? – but you certainly come closer than most.|06-19-2014|pisces
195|Money and possessions are important, of course, but don’t make too big an issue of them. Over the next few days you should concentrate more on relationships, especially your family ties. It’s who you love, not what you owe, that truly matters.|06-20-2014|pisces
196|You cannot carry on at your current frantic pace, not if you value your health, so slow down a bit. Even an Aries needs to take a breather once in a while and the best way to do that is to spend more time with loved ones.|06-21-2014|pisces
197|Others may not approve of some of the ways you choose to make your mark on the world but you don’t care in the slightest. You are determined to be true to who and what you are. You certainly won’t be afraid to try something new this week.|06-22-2014|pisces
198|Don’t make life hard for yourself when you don’t have to. This will be one of those weeks when, if you sit back and relax, spend quality time with friends and just generally let things happen, life will be perfect in every possible way.|06-23-2014|pisces
199|A relationship may have been under strain of late but don’t despair. Before this week is over you will have patched up your differences and be the best of friends again. Sometimes it takes bad times to bring back the good times.|06-24-2014|pisces
200|Sometimes it is best to leave things to fate and as you are under divine protection at the moment nothing and no one can hurt you. Not that anyone in their right mind would want to try it anyway – an angry Aries is a sight to behold!|06-25-2014|pisces
201|Don’t stand back and watch life pass you by. Aries is a cardinal sign, meaning you have more drive and ambition than most, so there can be no excuses for not getting out into the world and making things happen. Go for it!|06-26-2014|pisces
202|Take care of family matters today. You will not only have the desire to do something about them but partners and loved ones will for once be co-operative, so make the most of the situation and spread a little happiness.|06-27-2014|pisces
203|If you go on a journey this weekend it will be a lot of fun but the planets warn it could also lead you in some unforeseen directions. Don’t promise to be somewhere at a certain time unless you are certain you can make it.|06-28-2014|pisces
204|If something stops you in your tracks this week you should take it as a sign that you are to proceed no further. You can, of course, ignore the message and carry on but you will have no one but yourself to blame if it goes wrong.|06-29-2014|pisces
205|Honesty is by far the best policy, so get ready to tell a friend or loved one something you fear may turn them against you. According to the planets you will be surprised to discover they don’t really care – in the nicest possible way.|06-30-2014|pisces
206|If your inner voice tells you one thing but all your friends tell you the opposite you must go with your gut feeling. Not everything in life can be explained logically, so don’t be afraid to believe what others say cannot be possible.|07-01-2014|pisces
207|You have every reason to be confident but don’t get carried away and start believing that nothing can go wrong whatever you do. Your social life may be a lot of fun but is there something of a more serious nature you should be taking care of?|07-02-2014|pisces
208|Don’t worry too much about details today – focus on the bigger picture. That applies as much to your personal life as it does to your work. Don’t let friends and family pin you down to plans and timetables that stifle your creativity.|07-03-2014|pisces
209|You have to accept what is taking place in your life, even though you may not approve of it. There are times when even an Aries must bend with the breeze and this is one of them. Do what you have to do and do it well.|07-04-2014|pisces
210|Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse of your ruling planet Mars will help clear the air and make it easier for you to get your point of view across. Others may not entirely agree with you but they will respect your honesty and your passion.|07-05-2014|pisces
211|By all means agree to settle a disagreement between two friends but once you have delivered your verdict you are advised to stand back out of the way. Chances are that neither side will be happy and the fight will go on.|07-06-2014|pisces
212|Partnership issues will be important today, and money matters won’t be far behind. If nothing else you must resist the urge to splash out on expensive gifts for those you love – you may end up spending a lot more than you intended.|07-07-2014|pisces
213|Some people may be afraid to face the future but you are made of sterner stuff. You know that fate is what you make of it and today you are determined to make of it something grand. The future? Bring it on!|07-08-2014|pisces
214|Follow your instincts wherever they take you and don’t worry that you can’t yet see what your ultimate destination is going to be. You should know by now that it’s the journey that matters, so sit back and enjoy the ride.|07-09-2014|pisces
215|Steer clear of other people’s feuds today because if you allow yourself to get involved you will regret it over the weekend. There are rights and there are wrongs on both sides, so there is no point favoring one or the other.|07-10-2014|pisces
216|You seem to be torn between going all out to achieve your ambitions, on the one hand, and giving up on them altogether, on the other. Put off making a decision until after tomorrow’s full moon starts to wane next week.|07-11-2014|pisces
217|Something you have been working on for many months has reached the stage where you must decide whether to carry on with it or whether to call it a day. There is no middle ground – it must be one or the other.|07-12-2014|pisces
218|As Jupiter moves into the most dynamic area of your chart on Wednesday there is plenty you can do to further your creative potential. Try to be more light-hearted than you have been of late. The idea is to have fun.|07-13-2014|pisces
219|Resist the urge to make value judgments about other people. We all have different fates to follow and you cannot know what is right for someone else. The only behavior you should be concerned with this week is your own.|07-14-2014|pisces
220|Certain people have been difficult to deal with of late and the situation is unlikely to improve until the end of the week. The important thing is that you stay calm and don’t let negative feelings take control. Everything moves in cycles.|07-15-2014|pisces
221|You need to pay more attention to your work and your career over the next few weeks. Ask yourself what it is you are best at and what brings out your special creativity – then do that to the exclusion of everything else.|07-16-2014|pisces
222|You may be tempted to be nice to someone purely for what you think you can get out of the situation but do you have to be so mercenary? The planets urge you to put others first and to be genuinely interested in what they are doing.|07-17-2014|pisces
223|Even an active and ambitious Aries needs to take it easy once in a while and the planets are now urging you to relax after your recent exertions. Spend time with your family today – they would certainly like to see more of you.|07-18-2014|pisces
224|You may believe you are under divine protection, and maybe you are, but that is not an invitation to act recklessly. Yes, you have been a bit too defensive of late, but that does not mean you now have to take foolish risks.|07-19-2014|pisces
225|If someone makes you an interesting offer over the next few days don’t automatically assume there is a catch involved. The planets suggest that no matter what happens, be it good, bad or indifferent, you will always be well protected.|07-20-2014|pisces
226|You need to get tough with someone who has been giving you a hard time. People will respect you more if you demonstrate that you respect yourself. You don’t have to take anything from anyone, today or any other day of the week.|07-21-2014|pisces
227|The Sun moves into the most creative and dynamic area of your chart today, so expect to be busy. There may even be times when you move so fast you find it hard to catch your breath. No matter. You do your best work at high speed.|07-22-2014|pisces
228|If you listen to what other people are saying you will most likely learn something to your advantage today. The Sun in Leo means there are some pretty big opportunities coming your way, so keep your eyes and ears open – and act fast.|07-23-2014|pisces
229|Set yourself a new challenge. Commit yourself to a goal that others say is beyond your reach. With the Sun linked to Jupiter today there is nothing you cannot do. You will certainly take great delight in proving the doubters wrong.|07-24-2014|pisces
230|Your head may be full of big ideas but not every last one of them is practical, so don’t get carried away and do something silly. Tomorrow’s new moon indicates great things, but you must take your time and think things through.|07-25-2014|pisces
231|You will have so much energy at your disposal this weekend that you must find a positive outlet for it. Focus on creative activities and affairs of the heart and, whatever else you do, make sure you get plenty of excitement in your life.|07-26-2014|pisces
232|Why have you not been honest in your dealings with other people? According to the planets you have been telling loved ones and work colleagues one thing when you meant something quite different. Be careful your tactics do not rebound on you.|07-27-2014|pisces
233|Yes, your life is in a bit of a rut but you’re not the sort to sit there and cry about it – are you? Over the next few days you will get the chance to make some major changes, so start thinking now about what they might be.|07-28-2014|pisces
234|You will get more out of being sociable today than by sitting at home by yourself. In fact, someone you meet on your travels will open your mind to new ideas and new possibilities and you may never be quite the same person again.|07-29-2014|pisces
235|You may feel you have gone as far as you can go with a project but don’t give up on it yet. If you do you will most likely regret it next month when the omens are more favorable. Just put it on the back burner for a while.|07-30-2014|pisces
236|Are you any closer to reaching the targets you set yourself around the start of the year? If not, it may be time to adjust your sights a bit. Remember, targets don’t have to be set in stone – you can change them any time you wish.|07-31-2014|pisces
237|You are feeling a lot more positive about life now and that makes you more willing to get out into the world and rub shoulders with people who can be of benefit to you. Remember: nothing in life is so bad that a smile can’t improve it.|08-01-2014|pisces
238|You are sure to go overboard about someone today. It may be the start of a beautiful friendship, or it may just be a passing fancy, but either way it will be fun, so forget about the serious side of life and enjoy yourself.|08-02-2014|pisces
239|There will be a number of emotional issues to deal with over the next few days and there may be times when it all gets a bit much. Don’t worry. Later in the week everything will have sorted itself out and you will be smiling again.|08-03-2014|pisces
240|The Sun in Leo does wonders for your confidence and today you will go out of your way to show the world what a special person you are. One word of warning: a financial matter you have been neglecting still needs to be dealt with.|08-04-2014|pisces
241|The Sun in Leo will give you a huge boost today. Even if you are one of those rare Aries who tend to see the glass as half empty rather than half full you will be positive in everything you do over the next 24 hours.|08-05-2014|pisces
242|Try not to give the impression that you don’t know what is going on, because that will encourage rivals to keep you in the dark. Pretend you are on top of everything and, when all else fails, bluff your way through using lots of big words.|08-06-2014|pisces
243|You are in an adventurous mood and you will certainly want to explore further afield than usual today. However, Mars, your ruler, warns you should not stray into areas where you do not know your way around. Always know where the exit is!|08-07-2014|pisces
244|Something out of the ordinary will happen today, something you will be able to take advantage of. You have never been the sort to be modest about your achievements and a few days from now you will be singing your own praises!|08-08-2014|pisces
245|You are a rebel by nature and with the Sun linked to Uranus, planet of upheavals, this weekend you will do something totally outrageous. It may not do much for your reputation and it may even cost you money but you’ll have fun.|08-09-2014|pisces
246|Some sort of opposition is inevitable this week but you will deal with it with ease. No one has the right to tell you how to behave or how to manage your affairs and the sooner (and louder) you tell them that the sooner they will leave you alone.|08-10-2014|pisces
247|The planets are working in your favor at the moment, making it easy for you to make things happen. They also make it easy for you to resolve issues with partners and loved ones. Tell them how you feel – then just let it go.|08-11-2014|pisces
248|Get plenty of rest today because you are going to be super busy towards the end of the week. The planets will confront you with challenges that demand a strong response, so get an early night and be fit and ready to make your mark.|08-12-2014|pisces
249|When talking with other people today it might be wise to steer clear of emotional and controversial topics. The more certain individuals get worked up about what they believe the more you should keep your distance. It’s really not that important.|08-13-2014|pisces
250|On the face of it the deal you are being offered may seem generous but make sure you read the small print carefully before deciding if it is the right deal for you. The more others urge you to sign up the more suspicious you should be.|08-14-2014|pisces
251|It will pay you to take a closer look at how you organize your everyday affairs. You may not be able to escape all your chores and responsibilities but there are certainly ways you can make them easier to handle. Give it some thought.|08-15-2014|pisces
252|What occurs over the next 48 hours will convince you that so many of the things you have been worrying about are not worth the effort. Life will go on no matter what you think or say, so you might as well get out there and enjoy yourself.|08-16-2014|pisces
253|Some people may be difficult to get along with over the next few days but it’s no big deal so don’t make an issue of it. By the time the Sun changes signs on the 23rd you will have more important things to get excited about.|08-17-2014|pisces
254|The Sun in Leo gives you a head start over rivals and you must use it to pull ahead of them now and over the next few days. Think about ways you can improve on your current position. Get ahead and stay ahead.|08-18-2014|pisces
255|Even if you started the week determined to be on good terms with everyone you will still find it difficult, if not impossible, to get along with one particular individual. Face it, you are so far apart in so many ways that friendship is highly unlikely.|08-19-2014|pisces
256|Keep your ideas simple today, because the more complicated your plans get the more likely it is they will end in failure. You really don’t need to do anything out of the ordinary at the moment. Just be yourself – that’s more than enough.|08-20-2014|pisces
257|The Sun’s imminent move into the wellbeing area of your chart suggests you may feel a bit sluggish over the next few days. But that’s okay. It’s just your body’s way of telling you to slow down for a while. Listen to it.|08-21-2014|pisces
258|Do what others expect of you today, even if it means you have to put your own plans on hold for a while. Make sure friends and loved ones get all the encouragement they need. It’s inspiring to get praise from someone as go-ahead as you.|08-22-2014|pisces
259|The Sun may be moving out of the most positive area of your chart now but the good times won’t end – in fact they’ll keep getting better. What happens this weekend will remind you how blessed you are and how much you are loved.|08-23-2014|pisces
260|If the pressure of work is getting too much for you then, clearly, you are doing too much. What happens over the next few days will point out ways you can relax a bit while still getting the important things done. Don’t exhaust yourself.|08-24-2014|pisces
261|You would be the first to admit there have been times when you worked far too hard. Now your priority must be to respect your limits and, where possible, get some rest so you can rebuild your strength. Slow down as from today.|08-26-2014|pisces
262|You are under a lot of pressure at the moment but that’s no bad thing. You tend to do your best work when the heat is on. If there is one thing you enjoy it is a challenge that pushes you to the limits of your ability.|08-27-2014|pisces
263|If you feel trapped by your current situation you must find ways to cut yourself free. You are always impatient of restrictions and won’t let other people’s plans for you hold you back. You have your own plans and intend to follow them.|08-28-2014|pisces
264|You will get riled up about something today. There is nothing you hate more than injustice and you will go out of your way to expose it and oppose it. Someone with an outsize ego needs to be cut down to size.|08-29-2014|pisces
265|Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that affects joint finances warns you not to take chances with money. The more others tell you it’s okay to take a risk or two the more determined you should be to keep your cash in your pocket.|08-30-2014|pisces
266|If you do a good deed for someone in need this week it will come back to you many times over in the near future. Not only that but you will actually get a kick out of helping other people. Being nice can be its own reward.|08-31-2014|pisces
267|Let other people make decisions for you. The planets indicate this is one of those wonderful days when you don’t need to make much of an effort at all – just sit back and let the good things in life come to you.|09-01-2014|pisces
268|This is an excellent day for getting things done but be quick because the rest of the week will be taken up by relationship issues that eat into your time. Looking long-term, if you fancy a vacation don’t just think about it – do it.|09-02-2014|pisces
269|You need to pace yourself a bit over the next few days. In recent weeks you have thrown yourself into life like there was no tomorrow but not even an Aries can keep going indefinitely, so slow down and get your world back into balance.|09-03-2014|pisces
270|Whatever your aims and ambitions are right now they will change dramatically over the next few days. In fact, what happens today or tomorrow will in some way or other turn your plans on their head, so be ready for anything.|09-04-2014|pisces
271|Don’t concern yourself too much with details this weekend – life is too short to worry about what may or may not happen tomorrow. Besides, why should you exert yourself when it seems all your important needs have been taken care of?|09-05-2014|pisces
272|Sometimes a negative event can have a positive outcome and that seems to be what is occurring right now. Don’t worry too much about what goes out of your life over the next 48 hours – because something infinitely better will come in.|09-06-2014|pisces
273|Complete routine duties as quickly as you can this week because there are far more interesting things to spend your time and energy on. Others may say you are letting things slide but life is what you make of it – so make it fun.|09-07-2014|pisces
274|No one person is to blame for the predicament you are in, it’s just one of those things – so don’t start looking around for people to criticize. Besides, the problem can easily be solved – all you have to do is think logically and act fast.|09-08-2014|pisces
275|Find something constructive to do today, something that takes your mind off events that are best avoided. The full moon makes disputes and arguments easy to come by but they won’t do you any good, so find ways to stay out of trouble!|09-09-2014|pisces
276|You may prefer to avoid an unpleasant or embarrassing situation rather than face it head-on but deep down you know you are merely postponing the inevitable. Promise yourself you will deal with it today – and it won’t bother you again.|09-10-2014|pisces
277|Work and relationship issues may have placed a strain on your nerves in recent weeks but now you can see a way past your problems. A difficult phase is almost over – learn what you can from it and move on with no regrets.|09-11-2014|pisces
278|If you need to ask someone a favor, especially a financial favor, do so now while they are in a generous mood. When it comes to creative endeavors don’t sell yourself short – let everyone know they have a genius as a friend!|09-12-2014|pisces
279|As Mars moves into the most adventurous area of your chart this weekend your thoughts will turn to faraway places. Travel is very much on the cards over the next few weeks – all you need to decide is where, when and with whom.|09-13-2014|pisces
280|You must finish what you started over the next few days. According to the planets it is not the right time to start something new but it is the right time to complete a project that has been a bit-stop-start of late. Get busy.|09-14-2014|pisces
281|The final piece of a puzzle you have been struggling with will fall into place over the next two or three days. Once you can see the entire picture you will know why it took so long to make sense of it. You’ll enjoy the view too.|09-15-2014|pisces
282|You may be convinced that a certain course of action is correct but the strength of someone’s opposition will make you wonder if you have really got it right. Maybe you should give it a bit more thought. After all, what’s the rush?|09-16-2014|pisces
283|Your ideas may be amazing but unless you find practical ways of applying them to your everyday affairs they won’t do you much good. All you need is one simple idea that can be consistently applied – then you’ll find fame and fortune.|09-17-2014|pisces
284|Don’t compromise your principles today. You may think that others will admire you for your pragmatic approach, and maybe they will, but your rivals will see it as a sign of weakness. You must always stand up for what you believe in.|09-18-2014|pisces
285|A relationship may be going through a rough patch but the planets indicate there is nothing to worry about. Even so, you could still make things easier for yourself by not giving them the impression you don’t care, when you really do.|09-19-2014|pisces
286|Be fair and compassionate but don’t give others the impression that they can do as they please. The planets indicate that someone will try to make a drama out of what is really just a minor setback – but only if you let them.|09-20-2014|pisces
287|You may want to protect a friend from the consequences of their actions but deep down you know that’s not right. The only way they are going to learn from their mistakes is if they are on the receiving end for a change. Let it happen.|09-21-2014|pisces
288|If you believe from the start that something is going to go wrong then you increase the chances of failure ten-fold. Whatever you are involved with this coming week, keep telling yourself that you know it is going to succeed – and it will.|09-22-2014|pisces
289|If a romantic relationship is becoming a bit of a habit, the Sun in your opposite sign of Libra as from today will help you recover some of the sparkle that has been lost. Where true love is concerned it is never too late to start again.|09-23-2014|pisces
290|The new moon in your opposite sign of Libra means you cannot expect other people to automatically follow your lead. Believe it or not they have minds of their own and it looks like they intend to make use of them today.|09-24-2014|pisces
291|Uranus in your sign can at times makes you feel a bit tense but today’s link to Jupiter, planet of good fortune, will chill you out no end. Partners and loved ones will see the difference in your attitude, and respond in kind.|09-25-2014|pisces
292|You seem to have overdone it recently and now need time to recover from your exertions. Even so, Aries is never inactive for long and come the beginning of next week you will be on the go again. Where to? Almost anywhere!|09-26-2014|pisces
293|Long-term money matters should be easier to deal with now that Mercury is moving into the wealth area of your chart. If your instincts tell you that someone is trying to cheat you don’t ignore them. The only financial advisor you need is yourself.|09-27-2014|pisces
294|The choices you make about a relationship will have to be lived with for months, maybe years, so think carefully before making your move. Remember, too, that although you may be tough you do sometimes need a shoulder to cry on.|09-28-2014|pisces
295|No matter how hard it may be to master a new technique you will do so eventually, so keep at it and don’t give up. At some point over the next two or three days you will find it suddenly, and marvelously, comes easy to you.|09-30-2014|pisces
296|You must honor your side of some sort of bargain. If you don’t your reputation will head south faster than you thought possible. But, of course, it works both ways – you can demand that others live up to their obligations as well.|10-01-2014|pisces
297|No one doubts your dedication but are you dedicated to the right goals? The planets warn you should not aim at a particular target just because you think it is expected of you. Be true to your Aries nature: ignore the status quo.|10-02-2014|pisces
298|A relationship needs sorting out immediately. The planets urge you to be totally honest about your emotions, even if you fear it may hurt someone’s feelings. How they react will in fact tell you a lot about your long-term prospects.|10-03-2014|pisces
299|You will come up against an obstacle this weekend that will take a little more time and patience to get around. Life has been good to you recently but you still have to fight to get certain things done and this is a reminder of that fact.|10-04-2014|pisces
300|You will have important duties and responsibilities to deal with over the next few days but if you approach them in a light-hearted manner they will actually be a lot of fun. Life does not have to be sad or serious all the time.|10-05-2014|pisces
301|It may be hard to figure out why a loved one is behaving badly but there is a reason and you should look for it. On the work front you are advised to take what others say as the opposite to what they actually mean.|10-06-2014|pisces
302|Leave your cares, worries and responsibilities behind and do something that truly inspires you. It does not matter what it is so long as you enjoy it, and that applies as much to your personal life as it does to your work. Take a break from routine.|10-07-2014|pisces
303|You are well on the way to achieving something that only a short while ago appeared to be out of reach, but you are not quite there yet. Today’s eclipse in your opposite sign means you have one last hurdle to overcome and one last doubter to convince.|10-08-2014|pisces
304|Face up to emotional problems. Don’t try to sweep them under the carpet. There is a time and a place for everything and this is the time and the place to make your feelings known. Be honest with others and tell them to be honest with you.|10-09-2014|pisces
305|What seemed such a sensible idea yesterday may now appear a little silly but don’t give up on it. In there somewhere is the germ of a really good plan and it can be made to work if you refuse to be disheartened – and keep thinking.|10-10-2014|pisces
306|You don’t have to co-operate with people if you don’t want to but it’s unlikely you will get far on your own. On a personal level, try to understand that blame rarely rests all on one side or the other. Find a middle ground you can agree on.|10-11-2014|pisces
307|You need to find the right combination of inspiration and perspiration over the next seven days. Make sure too that your efforts, especially on the work front, are for a reason, not just because you are doing what others expect of you. |10-12-2014|pisces
308|You know from long experience that you should always listen to your inner voice. And what that voice is telling you today is that some kind of relationship problem is not as bad as you think it is. Give it time and it will heal.|10-13-2014|pisces
309|Some people will seem more demanding than usual over the next 24 hours, both in your personal life and at work, but that’s okay. You are both willing and able to respond to their needs and that will do your reputation no harm at all.|10-14-2014|pisces
310|You need to be flexible if you are to make the most of what the next few days have to offer. As for the next 24 hours: what appears serious will have a fun side and what seems like a joke could have far-reaching consequences.|10-15-2014|pisces
311|You trust your own judgment, of course, but can you trust the judgment of people who in your eyes have yet to prove themselves? You may have no choice in the matter today as the planets suggest that your fate is in their hands.|10-16-2014|pisces
312|The mood you start the day with is the mood that will remain with you until the start of next week, so find something to cheer you up and get you smiling. No matter what the doomsayers may claim the world is still a fantastic place.|10-17-2014|pisces
313|It’s time to resolve outstanding financial issues and put yourself on a more stable footing where money matters are concerned. You don’t have to make huge sacrifices but you do have to  make sure you know what is owed and what is due. |10-19-2014|pisces
314|A friend will offer you some good advice today and if you are sensible you will act on it. The solution may be painful in the short-term but if you leave a business or financial issue unresolved it could be hugely costly in the long-term.|10-20-2014|pisces
315|Don’t spend forever trying to work out the best way to tackle a difficult situation, just do what feels right at this moment and throw yourself into it. Trust that fate will guide you in the right direction – and your trust will be rewarded.|10-21-2014|pisces
316|You are being far too negative about the future. What happens over the next two or three days will encourage you to believe that in all areas of your life what you have to look forward to far outweighs what you have to fear.|10-22-2014|pisces
317|The planets warn that someone you meet on your travels today is trying to hide something from you, something you need to be aware of. Dig a little deeper than usual and find out what they are up to. You can still easily outwit them.|10-23-2014|pisces
318|Let relationship issues take care of themselves today and over the weekend. You have spent too much time in recent weeks worrying about how others are coping with their emotional upsets when it is your own needs which need attention.|10-24-2014|pisces
319|According to the planets you are about to achieve the breakthrough you have been dreaming of. As Mars moves into the career area of your chart on Sunday you will rediscover the ambition and sense of purpose you appear to have lost.|10-25-2014|pisces
320|You may not be able to make much sense of what happens over the next few days but that does not mean there is not a solution. Perhaps you are trying too hard or maybe you are looking in the wrong direction. Try shifting your perspective slightly. |10-26-2014|pisces
321|You are in two minds what you should be doing. One half of you wants to be sociable but the other half wants to shun the limelight. Why not do both? Dedicate the daylight hours to meeting people and the nighttime hours to enjoying some solitude.|10-27-2014|pisces
322|You will know without understanding how you know when others are lying today. No matter how persuasive certain individuals may be you would be a fool not to act on your instincts when the mental and emotional alarm bells start to ring.|10-28-2014|pisces
323|No matter how hard and fast you work today you won’t be able to get on top of your schedule, so just tackle what needs to be done at your own speed and don’t worry about the timing or the end product. You’ll get there eventually.|10-29-2014|pisces
324|If nothing seems to add up today it’s not because you are stupid but because you are trying to solve a problem that simply has no answer. It’s okay to admit it – you don’t have to be in control of each and every situation.|10-30-2014|pisces
325|You would benefit from a slower, more thoughtful approach to life over the next 48 hours. Time spent thinking now will be highly productive in the long-term, even though certain people may think you are being uncharacteristically lazy.|11-01-2014|pisces
326|Don’t let negative thinking get the better of you as the new week begins. Focus on what you are good at and trust in the planets to guide you in the right direction. Today’s Sun-Pluto link urges you to be extraordinary. |11-03-2014|pisces
327|Something that seemed so simple a few days ago now looks remarkably complicated. Maybe it is, or maybe it’s just your mind cooking up obstacles that are not really there, but whatever the reason don’t make any hasty decisions today. |11-05-2014|pisces
328|Try not to be impulsive or you could end up paying out a lot more than you can afford. A “one time offer” is nothing of the sort and you must not fall for it. The safest place for your money today is in your pocket.|11-06-2014|pisces
329|Try not to be distracted by promises of fame and fortune today and over the weekend. No matter how ambitious an Aries you happen to be you need to devote most of your time and energy to relationships – and one special relationship in particular.|11-07-2014|pisces
330|What you need to realize this weekend is that some rules can safely be broken but other rules must be obeyed. If you are smart you will spend some time working out which is which. If you get it wrong it could cost you serious money.|11-08-2014|pisces
331|Don’t try to control each and every aspect of your life leave some things to chance. Do what feels right for you in the moment and, just as important, allow others to do what feels right for them too.|11-09-2014|pisces
332|You may not want to get involved in a dispute between work colleagues but you have no choice. The moment things start to get heated is the moment you must step in and calm things down. Looks like it’s your turn to be the peacemaker.|11-10-2014|pisces
333|Over the next few days you will find yourself in situations which demand that you take a leadership role – something you are rather good at. Don’t forget though that with authority comes responsibility. Don’t let power go to your head. |11-11-2014|pisces
334|If you keep an open mind about a money matter you will see possibilities and opportunities other people are likely to overlook. Life is full of surprises and you will be happily surprised how easy it is to turn a profit today.|11-12-2014|pisces
335|Do what you can with what you have got and you will get what you need – that is the message of the stars for you today. Too many people expect life to come to them, but you’re far too smart to be one of them.|11-13-2014|pisces
336|Don’t let self-doubt creep into your mind today. If a certain course of action was right before then it is still right now. There is nothing wrong with what you are doing but your attitude could be better. Be positive – and make it happen.|11-14-2014|pisces
337|Keep your attention focused on what is important this weekend. If you allow your mind to wander you will waste time and energy on matters that are of little or no importance. Identify your goal, then go for it. |11-15-2014|pisces
338|You may feel that a target is beyond your reach but you can get there if you are prepared to make sacrifices. Whether you choose to do so or opt for an easier objective is up to you but you must make a decision quickly.|11-18-2014|pisces
339|Timing is always important and never more so than now. Don’t be afraid to approach people in positions of power if you have an idea to put forward or if you would like to put yourself forward for promotion. You are guaranteed a positive response.|11-19-2014|pisces
340|Don’t let your passion get the better of you today. There is nothing to be gained and a great deal to be lost if you act purely on emotion. It will pay you to wait a day or two before deciding what to do about a relationship.|11-20-2014|pisces
341|The most important thing today is that you surround yourself with people you feel relaxed and safe with. A social invitation may look exciting but if it is outside your comfort zone you should give it a miss. It’s not really your scene.|11-21-2014|pisces
342|The Sun moves in your favor this weekend and there is a new moon as well, so you won’t lack for inspiration of an artistic nature. But do you possess the drive and the ambition to turn inspiration into success? Of course you do! |11-22-2014|pisces
343|There is nothing you cannot do and no one you cannot impress. Having said which there may be, over the next seven days, a tendency to drift along and take things easy. Force yourself to be dynamic and achieve something worthwhile.|11-23-2014|pisces
344|Don’t be too proud to accept a gift from a friend. Not only do you need what they want to give you but accepting it will make them feel good about themselves as well. It’s a win-win situation, so why reject it? |11-24-2014|pisces
345|Are you working harder for ever smaller returns? Or is that an illusion, brought about by your insistence on measuring things in material or financial terms. On a deeper, more spiritual level you are a lot better off than you were a month ago. |11-25-2014|pisces
346|You may feel out of step with other people today but don’t let it worry you.. Sometimes you just have to do your own thing, in your own way, at your own speed. Maybe you’re not out of step – maybe everyone else is!|11-26-2014|pisces
347|You will get the chance to perform an unselfish act today and you won’t hesitate for a moment. You may not receive any obvious rewards but you will feel good about yourself. Doing things for others is always a smart move.|11-27-2014|pisces
348|You have been known to jump to conclusions occasionally and according to the planets you made a value judgment recently that you can now see was totally and utterly wrong. It’s no big deal, just say sorry and get on with your life.|11-28-2014|pisces
349|You are going places now and the Sun in Sagittarius will make sure you experience so much that is new and exciting. Don’t wait for others to suggest what you should be doing, just follow your instincts and let them guide you. You won’t be disappointed. |11-29-2014|pisces
350|As your ruler Mars changes signs on Thursday maybe it would be best not to make any major decisions about friendships or finances, at least not yet. If you do have to make some kind of move though follow your instincts, not the “experts.”|11-30-2014|pisces
351|With your ruler Mars allied to Saturn today you possess stamina, steadfastness and a taste for success. All you have to do is decide on a target and go for it. Before the day is over you will have another triumph to your name. |12-01-2014|pisces
352|You can’t solve a personal problem until you actually admit that such a problem exists. Once you have done so, however, you will discover that a solution is easy to find. Most likely it was there all the time only you did not let yourself see it. |12-02-2014|pisces
353|Your emotions may fluctuate wildly today but nothing bad will come of it so long as you refuse to attach too much importance to the way you feel. Mars, your ruler, changes sighs tomorrow, which means something wonderful is on its way.|12-03-2014|pisces
354|Try to stay calm when dealing with relationship and family problems. You may have every right to get angry but what will it solve? According to the planets everything will come right in the end so why upset yourself? |12-04-2014|pisces
355|You will be your usual assertive self today and over the weekend and that’s good because you need to let certain people know that you are serious about your ambitions. Aim high and don’t stop until you reach the top.|12-05-2014|pisces
356|Some of the ideas you have this weekend may seem a bit outrageous, at least to other people, but you know they can be made to work. Get your thinking cap on and find ways to make your insights pay, financially and emotionally.|12-06-2014|pisces
357|A creative endeavor may have to take a back seat for a while but it’s no big deal – in fact it may even make you more productive in the long term. Stand back from the details of what you are doing and let the bigger picture inspire you.|12-07-2014|pisces
358|This week should be noticeably easier than last week and soon you will be back to your best and raring to go. Today, however, you may have to deal with a problem you would like to pretend does not exist. In a few days it won’t. |12-08-2014|pisces
359|What occurs today will cause you to question some of your most deeply-held beliefs. Could they actually be wrong? Could it be the world is not designed the way they told you it was? Time for some deep thinking it seems.|12-09-2014|pisces
360|Don’t hesitate to be ambitious. If you dream about moving up in the world, if you want to be someone special, there is a real chance that it might happen this week. At the very least you will lay the foundations for future success.|12-10-2014|pisces
361|Make the most of today’s positive influences to start something new. This is a great time for career maters and also for affairs of the heart and over the next few days you may find the two linked in some way. Sounds like fun! |12-11-2014|pisces
362|There is no need to feel threatened by someone whose power exceeds your own. According to the planets they don’t see you as a rival and therefore wish you no harm. If you can, get in their good books – they could be a useful ally.|12-12-2014|pisces
363|Someone you live with or work alongside is likely to be in a negative frame of mind this weekend, so steer clear of them if you don’t want their mood to rub off on you. Life is as good or as bad as you choose to make it.|12-13-2014|pisces
364|You will need to be ruthless with yourself this week, especially on the work front where you are clearly doing too much. The tasks you are trying to finish may seem important but at least half of them could be postponed indefinitely.|12-15-2014|pisces
365|It may seem as if someone has taken advantage of your kindly nature but could it be you are overreacting? Even if they have been less than honest has it done any real harm? Get uptight about it if you want but it’s really not worth the effort. |12-16-2014|pisces
366|You have the gift of the gab at the moment and can get just about anyone to do just about anything for you. Which is nice but try not to abuse the situation or you may have some uncomfortable questions to answer later on. |12-17-2014|pisces
367|You may be in a charitable mood at the moment but don’t get carried away and give away too much. Your luck is certainly changing for the better but you still need to make sure you have enough in reserve to cover unforeseen setbacks. |12-18-2014|pisces
368|Take care that in trying to find a solution to one problem you don’t create several more. If you are not absolutely certain you know what you are doing perhaps you should wait until Monday’s new moon gives you a pointer.|12-19-2014|pisces
369|The Sun crosses a major angle of your chart this weekend, making it the ideal time to look into the future and decide what kind of life you would like to be living a few years from now. Set your sights high because all things are possible. |12-20-2014|pisces
370|You should be aiming to improve yourself in one way or another over the next seven days. You don’t have to make fame and fortune your priority but you do have to make the most of your talents – it’s a waste if you don’t.|12-21-2014|pisces
371|Colleagues and employers may need some convincing that what you are planning is going to work but that won’t bother you in the slightest because you have total self-belief. It’s going to be a great week for starting new schemes and projects.|12-22-2014|pisces
372|You can’t always pound your rivals into submission. Sometimes you need to be a bit more subtle and Saturn’s influence over the next few days will encourage you to think before you act. If you are going to be ruthless with anyone, be ruthless with yourself. |12-23-2014|pisces
373|Someone who needs assistance will turn to you today and you won’t let them down. There are few things you like better than charging to the rescue, especially when you believe that you are backing the underdog against a bully. |12-24-2014|pisces
374|If a friend or family member wants to go their own way and do their own thing then let them. Would you listen to them if they tried to stop you from following your desires? Of course not, so why should they listen to you? |12-25-2014|pisces
375|If you are nice to someone who does not deserve it today you will benefit in unexpected ways early in the new year. People in positions of authority will take note of your attitude and single you out for bigger and better things. |12-26-2014|pisces
376|No task will be too much for you this weekend. You will get stuck in quickly to whatever is expected of you and do the kind of job that is beyond most people’s abilities. But you’re not most people – you’re an Aries! |12-27-2014|pisces
377|Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart means you have what it takes to succeed but it is unlikely to happen until you stop worrying that your desire to get ahead in the world is somehow unnatural. It isn’t, so go for it!|12-28-2014|pisces
378|You may be desperate to get things moving again but don’t jump the gun. You will get your chance to shine towards the end of this week but until then you must sit tight and not rock the boat – or it might be you who falls out! |12-29-2014|pisces
379|Whatever happens today, be it “good” or be it “bad”, you must look at it as an opportunity. While others are getting emotional about it you should be evaluating the situation carefully and seeing how you can make it work in your favor.|12-30-2014|pisces
380|Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart makes you intensely ambitious but it can also make you a bit reckless and that could be a problem today. Be warned: if you take a short cut it could lead to some place you don’t want to go. |12-31-2014|pisces
381|Don’t be misled if things seem quiet today – it’s the lull before the storm. The first few days of the new year will be challenging, so conserve your energy for what lies ahead. Since when have you ever met a challenge you could not handle? |01-01-2015|pisces
382|You will come into contact with some powerful people in the early days of the new year. How you deal with these people is of the utmost importance. By all means show them how ambitious you are but don’t be pushy about it. |01-02-2015|pisces
383|Whatever happens today, be it good or be it bad, you won’t care so long as you are in the company of friends. Together you can face whatever challenges life sends your way, though by recent standards they are unlikely to be too tough. |01-03-2015|pisces
384|You may not have a care in the world at the moment but the same cannot be said for everyone you meet. Monday’s full moon will have some of your friends feeling a bit down. What can you do to cheer them up? |01-04-2015|pisces
385|If you get in a fight with someone who is bigger or better connected than you today you will undoubtedly lose, so be smart and back off before the situation gets out of hand. Full moons and confrontations don’t go together. |01-05-2015|pisces
386|Serious thoughts should be shoved to the back of your mind today. This is not a time to focus on money or career matters, this is a time to indulge in the lighter side of life. Make having fun your highest, and only, priority today. |01-06-2015|pisces
387|You will need to control your feelings today, especially if someone you thought you could trust lets you down in some way. There is no point getting upset about something you cannot change – either ignore it or deal with it.|01-07-2015|pisces
388|Don’t worry too much about details today. Instead, make a conscious effort to raise your sights and look at the bigger picture. If you don’t, you could miss something important – and that something has the potential to make you rich. |01-08-2015|pisces
389|Anyone who thinks they can get you to believe something that is clearly untrue obviously does not know you too well. Pretend to go along with what they tell you, then turn around at the last moment and tell them to get lost! |01-09-2015|pisces
390|You feel the need to draw attention to yourself and with Jupiter active this weekend that won’t be too difficult. Just be careful you don’t do anything too outrageous because if you do you may not be able to show your face for a while.|01-10-2015|pisces
391|A friend or colleague will say something that really worries you during the early part of the week but what you need to realize is they don’t know what they are talking about. There is absolutely nothing to worry about, not for you anyway. |01-11-2015|pisces
392|You may be in a cautious mood as the new week begins but that’s okay because this is a time for thinking things through rather than throwing yourself at life. Be patient and wait until you find something that is worthy of your time and energy. |01-12-2015|pisces
393|Try to be more logical in your thinking. If you look honestly at what happens today you will realize it is nowhere near as bad as certain people try to make out. By all means take it seriously but, no, it’s not the end of the world. |01-13-2015|pisces
394|You need to be less predictable in your words and actions, especially when dealing with co-workers and people in positions of power. Too many people are taking you for granted – and will continue to do so until you do something about it. |01-14-2015|pisces
395|The best way to get what you want right now is to pull strings behind the scenes. If you try to tackle problems head-on today you may find yourself up against people who are stronger and better connected than you – and you’ll lose.|01-15-2015|pisces
396|Good fortune is heading your way. You may find that hard to believe but if you adopt a more positive outlook today and over the weekend it will help you to recognize just how lucky you are. Life is good, and getting better by the moment.|01-16-2015|pisces
397|You will be called on to make an extremely important decision this weekend and if you get it right you will soon be moving up in the world. It’s not fame and fortune you seek, of course, but you’re not going to turn them down! |01-17-2015|pisces
398|You have started many new things in recent weeks and it is only natural that you are eager to see results. That’s more likely if over the next few days you make friends with people whose dreams in some way reflect your own. |01-18-2015|pisces
399|You may be assertive by nature but you also possess considerable charisma and with Venus so strong in your chart at the moment you will charm the birds from the trees. Say the right things to the right people at the right time and you’ll go far. |01-19-2015|pisces
400|You have started many new things in recent weeks and now you want to see some results. But don’t push too hard as there is still a lot to be done before the big breakthrough comes. You can be patient when you put your mind to it. |01-20-2015|pisces
401|Stick with what you know and trust and don’t be tempted to try something you are not familiar with. Yes, you may be adventurous by nature but with Mercury beginning one of its retrograde phases mistakes are more likely than not, so take care.|01-21-2015|pisces
402|Do not, repeat not, get emotional about money. Yes, of course, it’s nice to have enough of the stuff not to have to worry about paying the bills but at the end of the day it’s still just bits of colored paper. Keep a sense of perspective.|01-22-2015|pisces
403|This will be a really busy day for you and you will get so many important tasks out of the way. But don’t forget about love. Let that special someone know how you feel and let them see they mean the world to you.|01-23-2015|pisces
404|Before you get angry with someone for getting something wrong make sure you know all the facts. You won’t make many friends if your accusations turn out to be unfounded. Sometimes you can be a bit too quick to pass judgment.|01-24-2015|pisces
405|This is a busy time for you personally and you are on the go non-stop, but not everyone will be able to keep up. You will get more out of friends and colleagues in the long-term if you let them move at their own pace now. |01-25-2015|pisces
406|A problem of some kind can quite easily be resolved, by ignoring it. This is one of those situations where something is an issue only because you choose to think of it as an issue. So don’t think of it at all. |01-26-2015|pisces
407|Don’t waste time worrying that you may not have the skills or the experience to make a success of a new task or job – others have confidence in you so you must have confidence in yourself. Get used to playing a bigger role.|01-27-2015|pisces
408|Travel arrangements may be subject to delays and disruptions today, so give yourself plenty of time to get where you need to be and, if you do get held up, take it in your stride. You won’t be the only one arriving late. |01-28-2015|pisces
409|You will say or do something controversial today and those who are not as open and honest as you won’t like it one bit. Too bad. As far as you are concerned there is way too much conformity in the world. Rock the boat a little. |01-29-2015|pisces
410|Certain people may try to talk you down today but you won’t let it happen. The more they try to convince you that certain goals are beyond your reach the more determined you will be to prove them wrong. No one beats an Aries.|01-30-2015|pisces
411|Be tolerant of people whose views and opinions you don’t much like. You are going to have to deal with a wide range of people this weekend and you will deal with them better if you put your personal feelings to one side. |01-31-2015|pisces
412|Someone, somewhere needs your help and once you are aware of that fact you will drop what you are doing and come running to their rescue. No one is as eager to do a good deed as an Aries and you’ll do several this week.|02-01-2015|pisces
413|You will be asked to give your opinion on a controversial topic today and you must be honest about what you believe. Others will demand to know whose side you are on and it is in your own best interests to tell them. |02-02-2015|pisces
414|You will work best today if you work as part of a team. Try to remember that a certain amount of tension can be creative and that there is nothing wrong with a bit of dissent – so long as you all agree in the end. |02-03-2015|pisces
415|Some things can be explained purely by logic but what you have to deal with today will require you to use your intuition as well as your intellect. The first explanation that pops into your head is likely to be the right one.|02-04-2015|pisces
416|Don’t be in so much of a hurry that you bite off more than you can chew today. If you have to ask for help it won’t look too impressive, will it? Try not to get carried away, especially not on a stretcher. |02-05-2015|pisces
417|Don’t worry about how much something of a creative nature is going to cost you. If your plan is a good one – and it is – then the cosmic powers that be will help you. Take that risk and make it work. |02-06-2015|pisces
418|Switch off this weekend. Worry less. Do less. There may be a dozen things that need to be finished but you don’t need to finish them right now. Life can be as easy or as difficult as you choose to make it.|02-07-2015|pisces
419|People you work alongside will be impressed by your attitude over the coming week. They will especially admire the calm way you deal with pressure. Which just goes to show what a good actor you are, because inside you will be quaking with fear. |02-08-2015|pisces
420|You will find it ridiculously easy to get people to do what you desire over the next few days and you should take advantage of it. A smile here and a compliment there and they will be falling all over themselves to do you favors. |02-09-2015|pisces
421|Don’t try too hard to prove yourself to people who you do not respect – in fact, don’t try at all. It does not matter how important they are, you are under no obligation to be nice to them, or even to acknowledge their existence.|02-10-2015|pisces
422|You won’t take life too seriously today and that’s good because there are far too many glum faces around as it is. Do whatever takes your fancy, no matter how trivial it may seem to others. If it makes you smile it must be right.|02-12-2015|pisces
423|You will notice things today that other people have completely overlooked. But don’t expect many thanks when you point out what they have missed – some people just do not want to be told, not even for their own good.|02-13-2015|pisces
424|You were born with special skills and you are determined to make use of them. What happens over the weekend will bring new possibilities and maybe a new friendship or romance to go with it. Life is good and about to get even better.|02-14-2015|pisces
425|The Sun moves into the most secretive, sensitive area of your chart on the 18th but there is no cause to worry. It simply means you need to take time out of your busy schedule to think more deeply about your life. |02-15-2015|pisces
426|You may find that some of the things you have been doing in recent weeks no longer have the same hold over you. But don’t think that the time and energy you spent on them has been wasted – on the contrary, it was a good investment. |02-16-2015|pisces
427|You may be fearful for no good reason over the next few days, which is not like you at all. Remind yourself often that what you are anxious about exists solely in your mind and cannot affect you in the world at large. |02-17-2015|pisces
428|There is an air of mystery about you at the moment and others are having a hard time working out what you are up to. Chances are you are not up to anything much at all but it amuses you to have them think otherwise. |02-18-2015|pisces
429|Avoid extremes today, in words as well as actions. Mercury’s link to Saturn means you need to stay on good terms with everyone, but especially with people in positions of power – so think before you open your mouth. |02-19-2015|pisces
430|As your ruler Mars moves into your sign today you will be in an assertive and adventurous mood. Be careful though that you don’t get a bit too domineering for some people’s tastes. You don’t have to be full on every minute of the day.|02-20-2015|pisces
431|What would you do if you knew you could not fail? Then do it. The planets guarantee success this weekend, so believe in yourself and what you are doing and go all out to make it work. Your name will soon be up in lights. |02-21-2015|pisces
432|Keep a low profile early in the week, then show yourself towards the end of the week when there are fewer restrictions on what you can do. Also, try to realize that most of the things you have been worrying about exist only inside your head. |02-22-2015|pisces
433|You have been working behind the scenes a lot recently and no doubt that has been frustrating for someone as outgoing as you. On the other hand, being out of the spotlight enables you to do things you don’t want others to see! |02-23-2015|pisces
434|Someone you believed was trustworthy will show their true colors today. It seems they have been keeping things from you and you won’t be too pleased. In a way though they have done you a favor – you certainly know not to trust them again.|02-24-2015|pisces
435|You must expect one or two changes today, and if you are smart you will change yourself. The most important change you can make is in your attitude toward other people. Not everyone who disagrees with you has to be an enemy. |02-25-2015|pisces
436|You won’t be in the least bit shy about telling others what you think today but you are expecting too much if you expect everyone to agree with you. Don’t push your viewpoint too hard though or you may lose a few friends.|02-26-2015|pisces
437|A clash of egos is likely over the next 24 hours but that’s okay – it’s about time you reminded certain people that you are the boss. Don’t go too far though. Put them in their place by all means but don’t make a big fuss about it.|02-27-2015|pisces
438|Enjoy yourself this weekend – do the things that you want to do, not what other people say you should do. With luck planet Jupiter on your side that won’t be too difficult – there is something about you that oozes class and confidence.|02-28-2015|pisces
439|You seem to be in everyone’s good books at the moment. What have you done to deserve all this praise? Whatever it is make the most of it because things always change and Thursday’s full moon will bring you down to earth again. |03-01-2015|pisces
440|An older friend or family member will give you some invaluable advice and if you are smart you will take it to heart. You may be doing well at the moment but if you are willing to learn you will soon be doing even better. |03-02-2015|pisces
441|With luck planet Jupiter so strong in your chart this has to be one of the best times of the year for you. No matter how many occasions you have failed in the past you will succeed now, so aim high – then go even higher.|03-03-2015|pisces
442|A couple of days from now you will have to start making more of an effort, especially on the work front, but today and tomorrow almost everything will come easy to you. Love will certainly be on the agenda over the next 24 hours.|03-04-2015|pisces
443|Today’s full moon suggests you won’t be thinking straight, especially about matters related to your work and your wellbeing. Now that you know that you hopefully won’t take too seriously any doubts and fears that creep into your mind.|03-05-2015|pisces
444|By all means do something dramatic and decisive today but make sure you know what you are doing because the planets warn that you could easily overreach yourself. Remember, people in positions of power didn’t get there by being weak.|03-06-2015|pisces
445|Don’t make a fuss if a work-related issue does not work out the way you want it to this weekend. In the greater scheme of things it is of only minor importance, so let it pass and focus on something more agreeable, such as your love life.|03-07-2015|pisces
446|Mars, your ruler, allied to both Jupiter and Uranus over the next few days makes this the perfect time to start something big. Don’t worry that you may be aiming too high, worry only that you may fall short of your true potential.|03-08-2015|pisces
447|Later this month the Sun will move into your birth sign and a new solar year will begin. But you don’t have to wait until then to plan what you are going to do. Start now. The more you look ahead the more successful you will be. |03-09-2015|pisces
448|All things are possible. With your ruler Mars on excellent terms with luck planet Jupiter you can’t help but make a big impression over the next 24 hours. But will it be a good impression? Don’t let your ego get out of hand.|03-10-2015|pisces
449|No matter what you are working on and no matter how busy you may be at the moment, you must find an outlet for your physical desires. Mars, your ruler, is so strong today that mental challenges alone won’t be enough.|03-11-2015|pisces
450|You may have to rethink some of your plans over the next few days as Saturn begins one of its retrograde phases. Don’t give up on them completely though – just be aware that the road ahead may not be as straight as you imagined.|03-12-2015|pisces
451|The universe is pointing you in a particular direction and if you are smart you will go that way as quickly as you can. Of course, being an Aries you are equally as likely to go in the opposite direction just to be different. |03-13-2015|pisces
452|Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart is making you feel a bit vulnerable but you are not as fragile as you think you are. What happens over the next 48 hours will force you to toughen up. You’re not a victim.|03-14-2015|pisces
453|The Sun moves into your birth sign on the 20th and the world you thought was upside down will suddenly be the right way up again. Between now and then you are advised not to do anything too strenuous. Save your energy for the fun times to come. |03-15-2015|pisces
454|Do something original and meaningful this week, something that makes a difference. What that something is only you can decide but do it with other people rather than on your own. As a group you may, in some small way, change the world. |03-16-2015|pisces
455|If there is something you need to get finished this week you had better get on with it now. When the Sun moves into your sign on Friday there will be so many new things to focus on you won’t have time for yesterday’s aims.|03-17-2015|pisces
456|You may want to give someone the benefit of the doubt but a nagging voice in the back of your head warns against it. Today’s Mercury-Neptune link means that trust is something you can give but there is no guarantee it will be repaid. |03-18-2015|pisces
457|Someone will play on your emotions over the next 24 hours, maybe just for the fun of it but maybe also because they think they can get something out of it. Ruin their plans by refusing to get uptight. The more you smile the more you win. |03-19-2015|pisces
458|The Sun moves into your sign today and a new solar year begins. Just how good that year is going to be depends on the thoughts you have and the things you do over the next few days. Think big, act big and achieve big too. |03-20-2015|pisces
459|The Sun in your sign heralds a new beginning, so if you want to make changes now is the time. However, don’t go off in a mad rush because the moon’s eclipse of Mars, your ruler, could lead to mistakes being made. Start slow.|03-21-2015|pisces
460|Find a quiet place where you can be alone with your thoughts. Disappear off the grid for an hour or two. You need time to think through your problems. Alternatively, talk them over with someone you trust: they’ll have the answers you seek. |03-22-2015|pisces
461|Make sure you know what you are talking about today because if you make things up as you go along you are sure to be found out. It does not matter how confident you sound, if you don’t know the facts don’t pretend that you do. |03-23-2015|pisces
462|Today is a good day for meeting people and making deals. Your powers of persuasion are such that you can get almost anything you desire. But don’t be too pushy, especially on the work front – charm will get you further than aggressiveness.|03-24-2015|pisces
463|You feel you could take on the world and win but Saturn warns there are a number of duties and responsibilities you must deal with before you are free to express yourself. They might be boring, but they must be done – and done now. |03-25-2015|pisces
464|You will receive good news today, the kind that could make you some serious money. The only problem is you don’t seem to realize how good it is or how lucrative it could be. Open your eyes before someone beats you to it.|03-26-2015|pisces
465|If something feels good then just do it. As long as it is moral (and legal) it does not matter what other people might think about it. You have never been one to let criticism stop you before, so why start now?|03-27-2015|pisces
466|You have this nagging feeling in the back of your mind that you have done something wrong but you cannot work out what it is. Most likely it’s just a general feeling of guilt rather than anything specific. You do, after all, like to break rules.|03-28-2015|pisces
467|If a relationship is not going well then it is up to you to do something about it. Chances are all you have to do to make things better is to ask your partner why they feel down – and act on what they tell you.|03-29-2015|pisces
468|You seem to be working harder than ever but not getting much to show for it. Don’t worry. The Sun in your sign means you are guaranteed some sort of return on the efforts you are making – and when it arrives it will be worth it. |03-30-2015|pisces
469|If you have been looking to get rid of a responsibility that has become a burden then now is the time. The planets make it possible for you to cut important ties without creating resentment, so go for it and don’t look back.|04-01-2015|pisces
470|The Sun’s alliance with Jupiter today means you will come up with a solution to a problem before others even realize that a problem exists. This puts you at a huge advantage, personally and professionally – one you are entitled to use.|04-02-2015|pisces
471|You tend to prefer reason and logic instead of instinct but the approaching eclipse means you would be wise to listen more to your inner voice. You should also listen to friends and colleagues who know more about an issue than you do.|04-03-2015|pisces
472|Yes, of course, you know best but a partner insists that they know better. Today’s eclipse makes it highly unlikely you will be able to compromise, so go your own way and do your own thing and say “I told you so” when they get it wrong.|04-04-2015|pisces
473|Start thinking about what new things you would like to do over the next few weeks because you will soon get the opportunity to sweep away the past and make a new beginning. Whatever choice you make it should be a huge success. |04-05-2015|pisces
474|Your confidence is at an all-time high and you honestly believe there is nothing you cannot accomplish. Your capabilities may be immense but make sure you focus on aims that are worth investing your time and energy in. Don’t waste your talents. |04-06-2015|pisces
475|You will go over the top and say something excessive today but as you’re an Aries people tend to expect it of you. Just make sure you aim your barbed comments at people who can speak up and stand up for themselves.|04-07-2015|pisces
476|Some topics are best avoided today if you want to steer clear of heated arguments. The problem though is that the most divisive issues tend to be the ones on which you have most to say. Oh go on then, be controversial.|04-08-2015|pisces
477|What would you do if you knew that success was guaranteed? So why are you not doing it? The Sun in your sign makes all things possible but you have got to believe in yourself and you have got to be serious about your ambitions.|04-09-2015|pisces
478|Someone in a position of authority can and will help you out over the next 24 hours, if you ask them to. Not even an Aries can do it all by themselves, so get assistance if you need it. It never hurts to have powerful friends.|04-10-2015|pisces
479|Others can walk around with long faces if they want this weekend but you will be having the time of your life. Travel, socialize and party. Life is simple when stripped down to its essentials, so wear a smile and help others smile too.|04-11-2015|pisces
480|You won’t take life seriously over the next seven days and that’s good because there are already far too many people in the world who think it’s all doom and gloom. What is good? What is right? Whatever makes you laugh.|04-12-2015|pisces
481|Your passion for an issue or cause of some kind will inspire you to give of your best today. You certainly won’t give ground to those you disagree with so strongly. Compromise is not a word you want anything to do with. |04-13-2015|pisces
482|You like excitement but you need security too and the planets will in some way remind you today that matters of a business and financial nature must not be neglected. Have fun by all means but keep an eye on your cash too.|04-14-2015|pisces
483|It seems you can’t put a foot wrong at the moment but you know from long experience not to take things like that for granted – so don’t. Enjoy life by all means but watch where you tread. Avoid the toes of powerful people.|04-15-2015|pisces
484|You have no intention of giving in just because someone in a position of power is on your case. Anyone who thinks you will just roll over and play dead today will learn the hard way that you can bite as well as bark.|04-17-2015|pisces
485|A new moon in your sign means you need to decide what it is you most want to accomplish over the next six months or so. What you think of today is what you will be doing tomorrow, so think deeply – then take appropriate action.|04-18-2015|pisces
486|Anyone who tries to tell you how to live your life will soon wish they had kept their thoughts to themselves. You have no intention of sitting there listening to their lecture. And why should you? You know what your needs are. |04-19-2015|pisces
487|You may not have been serious about a social or political issue in the past but you are certainly serious about it now. You won’t rest until you’ve had your say and made your mark. You could make some money from it too.|04-20-2015|pisces
488|You want to make a useful contribution to what’s going on around you but the only way you can do that is to join with other people. You can be a loner if you wish but you will get more done if you are not so aloof.|04-21-2015|pisces
489|Just because someone seems to know what they are talking about does not mean you have to trust them – especially when it is your money that is on the line. Make sure you know the risks involved before signing up to anything today.|04-22-2015|pisces
490|Everyone gets things wrong once in a while and you are no exception. If you make an error of judgment today – and you will – don’t try to deny it. Accept your mistake then set about putting it right. It’s more than most people do.|04-23-2015|pisces
491|No, you are not the most subtle member of the zodiac, but why should you be? Your in-your-face attitude will work in your favor today, especially in your career where you need to be more assertive – yes, even more so than usual!|04-24-2015|pisces
492|Uranus in your sign is a fortunate influence and with Venus also strong this weekend you should be lucky in love as well. On the work front, listen to advice but don’t just assume others know what they are talking about. Do your own research. |04-25-2015|pisces
493|You will get your way no matter how many people try to deny you. But make sure what you get is what you really want because once it is yours you will be stuck with it – you won’t be able to change your mind and give it back. |04-26-2015|pisces
494|If something goes wrong over the next 24 hours there are two approaches you can take: either you can look round for someone to blame or you can take responsibility yourself. Make it the latter and make sure the problem gets fixed.|04-27-2015|pisces
495|Life is good and getting better by the day, the hour, even the moment. You may find that hard to believe but only because you are focusing on things that are no longer of any importance to you. Expand your horizons, and have fun.|04-28-2015|pisces
496|Opportunities to better yourself won’t be hard to find over the next few days, so stay alert and be ready to act when you get the chance. Nothing is impossible if you want it enough and Aries is nothing if not ambitious.|04-29-2015|pisces
497|A problem will most likely resolve itself if you stop worrying about it so much. Mercury’s imminent change of sign will help you to focus your thoughts on more constructive issues. Never forget it is your head that makes your world.|04-30-2015|pisces
498|Mercury’s change of sign today urges a change in attitude on your part. Try taking a step back from what you have been stressing about over the past few weeks. Most likely you will see that it is not so important after all.|05-01-2015|pisces
499|Partners and loved ones may think they know what is best for you, and maybe they do, but that does not mean you should let them take over your life. Once they are allowed to decide one thing for you they will soon want to decide everything.|05-02-2015|pisces
500|If you make an effort over the next seven days you will make a major breakthrough. Not everyone will agree with your aims and ambitions but then not everyone possesses your sense of adventure or self-belief. Go for it! |05-03-2015|pisces
501|Don’t worry about today’s full moon – if you think positive then all will be well. Others may not be so lucky, of course, so be ready for one or two emotional outbursts from people who get easily frustrated with life’s little setbacks. |05-04-2015|pisces
502|You may be able to do anything but that does not mean you have to do everything. Decide what it is you are really good at and commit yourself to it 100 per cent. Focus all your energy in one direction and see incredible results.|05-05-2015|pisces
503|Meet up with friends and do things together today. And don’t just limit yourself to social activities. If you get the chance to join forces with people who share your aims and ideals then do so. Make the world a better place.|05-06-2015|pisces
504|You will need to be on your guard today as someone you work or do business with seems to think you can be easily misled. Check everything you are told, even if it sounds true. Then check it a second time just to make sure.|05-08-2015|pisces
505|Be careful what you allow yourself to think about this weekend. With Mercury, planet of the mind, at odds with Neptune, negative thoughts are sure to have negative consequences. Positive thoughts, on the other hand, will bring extraordinary success.|05-09-2015|pisces
506|You will want to be on the move over the next few days, so don’t make plans that keep you in one place only. There is a danger that you might be a bit too forceful verbally but that will worry others more than it worries you. |05-10-2015|pisces
507|Do something today that takes the object of your affection by surprise. Think of the most romantic thing you could do, then do it and watch their passion ignite. And plan a trip away together for later in the week or next weekend. |05-11-2015|pisces
