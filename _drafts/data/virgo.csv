0|Spend some time alone as the new week begins so you can think deeply about what you are going to do between now and the end of the year. Give friends and relatives a miss or they will pester you with all sorts of problems.|12-01-2013|virgo
1|Some things you can see from a long way away but others things you don’t see until you are right up in front of them. You’re not the only one to see something so important so late in the day, so don’t make a big deal of it.|12-02-2013|virgo
2|There are times when you let the mask of self-control slip and let your emotions get the better of you and that will most likely happen today. If it does it may be to your benefit. Let others see you are not just practical but passionate too.|12-03-2013|virgo
3|Family relationships are under favorable stars at the moment, so reach out to someone you love and let them know how you feel. Some say Virgos are cool and calculating, so now is your chance to prove them wrong.|12-04-2013|virgo
4|What happens today, tomorrow and over the weekend may at times look chaotic but if you stand back and cross your eyes slightly you will see there is a pattern to it all. Never doubt that, bit by bit, your life is moving in the right direction. |12-05-2013|virgo
5|You have good reason to be annoyed with someone but because you are such an agreeable individual you may allow them to wriggle out of it just by saying the right words. That would be a mistake. Don’t forgive quite so easily.|12-06-2013|virgo
6|For some reason you seem unable to bring yourself to say what you believe. Could it be because you know your opinions will upset other people and you just don’t want the hassle? What happened to your regard for the truth?|12-07-2013|virgo
7|You seem to be plagued by a lot of irrational fears at the moment. According to the planets your worries are mainly if not entirely in your own mind, so focus on positive things and ignore whatever it is that makes you feel anxious. |12-08-2013|virgo
8|You will encounter hostility of some sort over the next 24 hours, most likely from someone who resents your ability to point out where they are going wrong. If it gets heated you would be wise to turn your back and walk away.|12-09-2013|virgo
9|You are in a carefree mood at the moment and should make it your mission to cheer up friends and family members who do not share your happy-go-lucky outlook. You can’t change the world but you can make some people smile.|12-10-2013|virgo
10|It would appear that your authority on the work front has slipped a bit of late and you need to find ways to remind people why they should do what you tell them. Be persuasive but don’t be rude. Leaders need followers who respect them.|12-11-2013|virgo
11|If you have started on some kind of scheme then you must see it through to the end. Having come so far and invested so much time and energy you cannot give up on it now. Besides, it could work out better than you expected.|12-12-2013|virgo
12|Saturn may be casting a cloud over money matters at the moment but you can still have fun. Besides, if you keep a tight hold of the purse strings now you will have more to spend over the holiday period and party season.|12-13-2013|virgo
13|You have made a lot of sacrifices, both at home and at work, and over the next few days you will begin to see what it has earned you. New opportunities will come your way and new people will come into your life. Use them.|12-14-2013|virgo
14|You may be dismayed to find that you are not quite so popular with employers and other important people over the next few days, but there is no need to worry. It’s just a passing phase and you will soon be flavor of the month again.|12-15-2013|virgo
15|Your confidence is sky-high at the moment and because of that you are ready to risk almost anything to prove you are the best. Before the day is over even your critics will be singing your praises and willing you to succeed|12-16-2013|virgo
16|Someone will be aggressive towards you today. What have you done to deserve being treated so harshly? Probably nothing but they may see it as getting their own back for something you said or did previously. Let it pass.|12-17-2013|virgo
17|People will be demanding of you today and there may come a time when you realize you are being taken for a ride. The fact is they could have done most of these things for themselves if they wanted to. Make them wish they had.|12-18-2013|virgo
18|If you feel the need to kiss and make up with a partner or relative now is the time. If you leave it much longer you may find that it isn’t so easy or, worse, that they have found the love they need with someone else. |12-19-2013|virgo
19|Check facts and figures today, especially those that a colleague says are okay and you don’t have to worry about. If you give them the green light to proceed now you may regret it later when what you’ve both missed costs you dear.|12-20-2013|virgo
20|If you have confidence in your abilities then there is nothing that can stop you from reaching your goals. As the Sun moves into the most dynamic area of your chart this weekend anything is possible for you. Yes, really – anything.|12-21-2013|virgo
21|Creatively and romantically this is one of the best times of the year for you, so decide what it is you want to achieve, then make it happen. Don’t listen to those who say you should not take risks, just do what feels right to you.|12-22-2013|virgo
22|Try to be more trusting, especially when dealing with people whose support could be vital in the future. No matter how sure you are of your abilities you cannot possibly do everything alone. And a second opinion is rarely a bad thing.|12-23-2013|virgo
23|This should be a productive day for you – you will get a lot done in a short space of time. Make the most of it because as you move into the new year you will find that not everything comes quite so easy. Be ruthless if you have to. |12-24-2013|virgo
24|You may not be thinking too clearly today but that will only be a problem if you are dealing with issues that are important. Steer clear of making any final decisions about things like your finances – they can wait until another day.|12-25-2013|virgo
25|Play to your strengths and don’t let what others are doing affect you in any way. There are some things you do better than most and those are the things you should be focusing on now. You will soon be moving ahead in leaps and bounds.|12-26-2013|virgo
26|With both the Sun and Venus traversing the most passionate area of your chart there is just no way you can keep your feelings to yourself. And why would you want to when your feelings are so positive? Spread the love around.|12-27-2013|virgo
27|If ever there was a time to make a major effort that time is now, because it will pay off big time over the weeks and months to come. Cosmic activity in the most dynamic area of your chart urges you to be creative. Take a few chances!|12-28-2013|virgo
28|If you are involved in anything of a creative or artistic nature it will go very well in the early days of the new year. It’s also a good time for affairs of the heart, so be creative in your love life too. No, it’s not true that Virgos are boring!|12-29-2013|virgo
29|There is something that needs to be said and you are the one who should be saying it. The information will come out anyway later in the week, so you might as well be the one to break the news. It will put you at a distinct advantage.|12-30-2013|virgo
30|A more assertive attitude is called for and with Mercury, your ruler, linked to power planet Pluto it shouldn’t be too hard. But don’t take risks with your money – no matter how assertive you are you will lose more than you gain. |12-31-2013|virgo
31|Today’s new moon takes place in the most dynamic and creative area of your chart, and with power planet Pluto in the mix as well you are sure to do something remarkable. Just make sure you do it for yourself and for loved ones, not strangers.|01-01-2014|virgo
32|The sooner you stop worrying about your money situation the sooner it will sort itself out. That might sound too good to be true but the more you torment yourself about something the more power you give it. Fix your mind on something else.|01-02-2014|virgo
33|Something that made no sense at all to you before will make perfect sense today. Most likely the thing itself has not changed but the way you look at it has. Next time, try listening to what friends and colleagues try to tell you.|01-03-2014|virgo
34|You may have to get tough and lay down the law this weekend, but only because you have been too soft in the past and let people get away with things they should have been held responsible for. Next time, don’t let it go so far.|01-04-2014|virgo
35|You will find that all sorts of people want to be nice to you over the next seven days. Does that make you suspicious? Don’t worry, the planets suggest their kindness is genuine, so if you need to ask favors, of anyone, now is the time.|01-05-2014|virgo
36|Although some may find it hard to believe you are very much in touch with your emotions and that’s good because if you rely entirely on your rational mind today you could miss out on something. Let your heart rule your head.|01-06-2014|virgo
37|Keep things simple today because the more complicated you allow your activities to get, the more likely it is you will get confused and make a mistake. Focus on essentials, and make sure they are easy to understand and put into effect. |01-07-2014|virgo
38|Do something different today, something that livens things up both at home and at work. Some people may think you have taken leave of your senses but they are just the sort of people who have been dragging you down. Ignore them.|01-08-2014|virgo
39|It seems you are enamored more by things than you are by people at the moment. Nothing wrong with that as such but take care that your material desires don’t detract from your relationships. Ultimately, only love truly matters.|01-09-2014|virgo
40|Take care you don’t get lulled into a false sense of security and end up making the kind of silly mistake you usually work so hard to avoid. It’s not like you to take things for granted, so check every last detail over the next 24 hours.|01-10-2014|virgo
41||01-11-2014|virgo
42|If you feel the need to clear the air then say what is on your mind. But be ready for the backlash, which won’t be long in coming. Some people, it seems, would rather you did not bring up subjects they feel uncomfortable with.|01-12-2014|virgo
43|The Sun is on your side and your confidence is high, so do something special over the next few days. By this time next week it won’t be so easy to stand out, so give it your all, creatively and romantically, while you can.|01-13-2014|virgo
44|The pace of life will pick up over the next few days, and that’s good. This is still one of the most creative and productive times of the year for you, so stop thinking about what you might accomplish and get out there and actually do it.|01-14-2014|virgo
45|As tomorrow’s full moon cuts across one of the more outspoken areas of your chart you won’t be at your most tactful when dealing with people whose opinions you do not share. But why should you be when you are right and they are wrong?|01-15-2014|virgo
46|The less you reveal about your plans the better. Keep your ideas to yourself and stay tight-lipped even if your best friends ask what you are up to. That applies just as much on the work front. The less others know, the better for you.|01-16-2014|virgo
47|According to the planets you are too close to a project and need to step back a bit if you are to get a realistic view of how you are doing – and what you need to do next. Ask a trusted friend what they think as well – their view could be enlightening.|01-17-2014|virgo
48|The Sun moves into the area of your chart that governs both your work and your wellbeing at the start of next week, so try not to exert yourself too much over the next 48 hours. You don’t HAVE to party each and every night you know!|01-18-2014|virgo
49|Think very carefully before taking on new duties and responsibilities this coming week. It does not matter that you can do twice as much as others, and do it twice as well, you must not allow yourself to be taken advantage of.|01-19-2014|virgo
50|Do whatever it takes to stay healthy and whole. If you don’t you will find yourself under increasing physical, mental and emotional pressure as your workload increases and your energy levels begin to decline. Put your wellbeing first – always.|01-20-2014|virgo
51|Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs your work and your well-being is warning you not to push yourself too hard. Your energy levels may be a bit low at the moment, so pace yourself sensibly and cut back on your commitments.|01-21-2014|virgo
52|You will get more done over the next 24 hours than you managed to get done in the past 24 days. But don’t think that means you have to work harder. On the contrary, you should cut back on your workload. Achieve more by doing less.|01-22-2014|virgo
53|If you take what someone tells you at face value you will miss what really matters. Before you make any kind of decision, either in your personal life or at work, make sure you know all the facts – not just the ones others want you to know.|01-23-2014|virgo
54|You tend to believe in only what you can see with your own eyes and touch with your own hands. But something will happen today that makes you wonder if there are other forces at work. Can you find a way to make them work for you?|01-24-2014|virgo
55|If someone tells you there is something you cannot have this weekend you will go out of your way to get it. But has it not occurred to you that they may be hoping you will react this way? It could be you are being deliberately misled.|01-25-2014|virgo
56|A part of you wants to do more but another part knows you are working too hard as it is. The only way to resolve this dilemma is to give up some things before taking on new tasks. Your time and energy are precious – and limited.|01-26-2014|virgo
57|Why merely fantasize about being in an environment where family and financial worries play no part when, with a little bit of effort, you can make it happen? Stop thinking and start acting this week. The future is in your own hands.|01-27-2014|virgo
58|You need to make a serious effort to sort out your problems with partners and loved ones. You may not want to make the first approach but if you do you won’t regret it. Show that you are ready and willing to talk things through.|01-28-2014|virgo
59|Something you have been worrying about for weeks, maybe months, will resolve itself in your favor today thanks to the new moon. Your relief will be huge but there is a lesson to learn too: nothing is ever worth getting too worked up about.|01-30-2014|virgo
60|Make the most of your current run of good fortune and make sure those you are closest to know how you feel about them. Chances are they know anyway but it never hurts to make sure. The words ” I love you” are never wasted.|01-31-2014|virgo
61|To get what you want at home or at work you will have to give other people what they want in return. Don’t do anything that goes against your principles, because even if you come out on top as a result your guilt feelings will haunt you.|02-01-2014|virgo
62|If you try to get out of something you have already agreed to today you won’t be the most popular Virgo in the neighborhood. That may not worry you much now but it could have repercussions later when you are dependent on other people.|02-03-2014|virgo
63|You may want to push ahead with a project that is close to your heart but according to the planets a colleague is having doubts and you must deal with those doubts first if you want to make progress. Maybe they’re on to something.|02-04-2014|virgo
64|Someone you have to deal with over the next 24 hours will talk non-stop without saying much of any great substance. Most likely, what they say will go in one ear and straight out the other — and you won’t have missed a thing. |02-05-2014|virgo
65|If a colleague makes an error and causes you problems today don’t make a big deal of it. Everyone makes mistakes – yes, even a Virgo – so let it pass and do what you can do make them feel better. You’ll feel good about yourself as well.|02-06-2014|virgo
66|It’s important that you don’t let your anxieties get the better of you, especially where your health is concerned. You tend to fear the worst for no good reason at this time of year but eventually your fears will fade. Attitude is everything.|02-07-2014|virgo
67|You have far too many things on the go at the moment, and you run the risk of losing control. You may not like to admit that you can’t do it all alone, but this would be a good time to get friends and family to help you out.|02-08-2014|virgo
68|Someone who is down on their luck will come to you for assistance today and you won’t have the heart to turn them away. Hopefully you will also have the sense to see that their troubles are of their own making. Point that out to them.|02-10-2014|virgo
69|It would be a mistake to take on any new tasks today — in fact, Saturn warns it could be disastrous. Far from adding to your workload you should be cutting back on your chores. Why make life tough when it doesn’t have to be? |02-11-2014|virgo
70|You may not see eye-to-eye with a certain individual but you can, if you make an effort, reach a compromise that satisfies you both. It’s quite possible to be allies in some areas and rivals in others, even though you may never be friends.|02-12-2014|virgo
71|It’s important that you are honest about your feelings. If you keep them to yourself then your negative emotions may build up to the point where an outburst of some sort is more likely than not. Let loved ones know how you feel.|02-13-2014|virgo
72|As today’s full moon occurs in the most sensitive area of your chart things you could not usually care less about will worry you. Provided you don’t act on those worries everything will be fine. Over the weekend you will realize it was all an illusion.|02-14-2014|virgo
73|Major opportunities are coming your way, any one of which could make your fortune. All you have to do is decide which one to focus on, then give it your all. Advice from the stars: don’t reject an idea just because you did not think of it yourself.|02-15-2014|virgo
74|Partners and colleagues and loved ones will go along with almost anything you suggest today, but only if you are polite and ask them what they think about it first. Don’t make life difficult for yourself when it should be easy.|02-17-2014|virgo
75|You will feel an attraction for someone who is as different to you as chalk is to cheese and it could be the start of a beautiful friendship – or more. Opposites often go well together and the planets suggest yours could be the perfect match.|02-18-2014|virgo
76|Someone who is jealous of your popularity will make life tough for you today, but they are unlikely to succeed. You are in one of those moods where negativity goes right over your head, and that will annoy them even more. Good. |02-19-2014|virgo
77|It may seem as if you are dancing to everyone’s tune but your own but why should that be a bad thing? Sometimes it’s nice to sit back and let others worry about where to go and what to do next. Life doesn’t have to be a drama.|02-20-2014|virgo
78|Something dramatic will happen today and most likely you won’t be that impressed. However, if you keep your wits about you this is one surprise that can be turned in your favor. Someone else’s fall from grace could make things easier for you.|02-21-2014|virgo
79||02-22-2014|virgo
80|Partners and colleagues have the upper hand at the moment and if you are wise you will let them make whatever decisions they want to make. But you must also make sure that if things go wrong it won’t be you who takes the blame.|02-23-2014|virgo
81|You are advised to take care this week as Mercury, your ruler, is still going through one of its difficult phases. Between now and Friday, when Mercury moves in your favor again, don’t take it for granted that what you are being told is true.|02-24-2014|virgo
82|Because the approaching new moon falls in the partnership sector of your chart you will find it easier to identify with and sympathize with other people’s worries. Help them if you can but don’t let their worries rub off on you.|02-25-2014|virgo
83|Patience is a must today because if you act impulsively you are sure to lose out. You may be frustrated that something you are working on is not progressing as smoothly or as quickly as you would like but, seriously, what’s the rush?|02-26-2014|virgo
84|You will find you are a lot more emotional than usual today. But that could actually work in your favor, especially if you have not been too open about your feelings of late. Every now and then it’s good to let it all come out.|02-27-2014|virgo
85|As from today you should find it easier to organize your daily routine and either get rid of or delegate jobs that take up a great deal of your time for very little in the way of rewards. Think clearly, take control and be decisive.|02-28-2014|virgo
86|Put yourself in someone else’s hands and trust their judgment. You may like to be in control of every aspect of your own existence but just this once you are advised to let go and let others lead and guide you. The results will delight you.|03-01-2014|virgo
87|Don’t plan anything too serious for the next few days because this is a time for fun. If work colleagues and employers expect you to knuckle down and get things done they are going to be disappointed. Find ways to make them laugh too.|03-02-2014|virgo
88|You may have to get tough with someone who has let you down but make sure you don’t let your anger take over because if you go too far you will lose your credibility. Virgos are supposed to be rational, not emotional.|03-03-2014|virgo
89|Try not to waste time and energy on people who are clearly not worth the effort. Certain individuals will always be ungrateful no matter what you do – it’s in their nature – so identify them and avoid them, as far as you can.|03-04-2014|virgo
90|Try to remember that it’s quality, not quantity, that counts. If you keep that point in mind today everyone will praise you for a job well done. If, however, you try to do too much you will end up pleasing no one, not even yourself.|03-05-2014|virgo
91|You want to get things done and you want to get them done now, but because not everyone is as motivated or dynamic as you it may take some effort to get others to help you. No, you can’t go it alone – there is too much to do.|03-06-2014|virgo
92|It is possible to be too generous and at some point today you will realize that your sympathy for someone was misplaced. There is no point getting angry about it, with them or with yourself, but try not to make the same mistake twice.|03-07-2014|virgo
93|Something you do for a friend or work colleague will have far-reaching consequences, both for them and for you. A small sacrifice now could lead to big gains later on, so put your own needs on hold and put yourself at their service.|03-08-2014|virgo
94|Don’t make any hard and fast plans for the next few days because cosmic changes around the time the Sun links to Saturn on the 13th will disrupt things hugely. That might sound ominous but chances are you will enjoy what occurs.|03-09-2014|virgo
95|No matter what problems or difficulties you face over the next few days you will be able to deal with them all. You will, of course, get them out of the way quicker if you ask friends and family to help you out. So ask!|03-10-2014|virgo
96|You will be in a serious mood today as Mercury, your ruler, squares up to Saturn. A number of things you once believed in will be called into question and so-called “facts” will no longer stand up to scrutiny. It’s time to get real.|03-11-2014|virgo
97|A positive outlook in the face of adversity is essential. Because Virgo is a sign that gets caught up in details you have a tendency to think it’s the end of the world when little things go wrong. It isn’t – and most likely never will be!|03-12-2014|virgo
98|Today’s Sun-Saturn link will encourage you to get serious about your prospects, especially in your career. Map out how you see your ambitions unfolding over the coming six months – and who you can rely on for support. Then make it happen.|03-13-2014|virgo
99|You will be tempted to take some kind of risk today and because your ruler Mercury is nicely linked to Mars, planet of action and energy, you may well pull it off. Don’t forget though that long-term success takes hard work and dedication.|03-14-2014|virgo
100|The full moon in your sign this weekend means you need to pay more attention to what partners and loved ones are up to. Have you been neglecting them of late? If so, make an effort to spend some quality time with them now.|03-15-2014|virgo
101|You will be easily irritated this week, especially by people who cannot make up their minds about things you decide on in an instant. Be reasonable. Not everyone is as quick off the mark as you, nor is there any reason why they should be.|03-16-2014|virgo
102|You won’t see eye-to-eye with someone today but that doesn’t matter – in fact it’s good. The world would be a boring place if, as utopian sorts might like, everyone got along all the time. Conflict can be fun, especially for the winners.|03-17-2014|virgo
103|No matter how irritating certain people may be you must not let them get under your skin. On the work front, especially, you need to relax and let life happen. The more you try to force things the more others will try to annoy you.|03-18-2014|virgo
104|If your sixth sense tells you that something is not quite right you must listen to it and refrain from doing anything that might lead you down the wrong path. That applies to all areas but especially to matters related to your long-term finances.|03-19-2014|virgo
105|The Sun’s change of signs means you need to change too. Most importantly, it means you need to get rid of ideas you are comfortable with but which in some ways are holding you back. Move with the times. Failing that, just move!|03-20-2014|virgo
106|It’s easy to find fault with other people, especially for someone as pernickety as you, but is your own life blameless? If you get too critical today you may find that someone turns the tables by highlighting your own failures. Embarrassing!|03-21-2014|virgo
107|Make a point of hearing both sides of a story before reaching a decision about who you are going to support. Just because someone knows how to talk louder and faster does not mean they have the better arguments. Listen to everyone.|03-22-2014|virgo
108|The more others demand to know what you’ve been up to the more mysterious you should be. Not because you have anything to hide but because by keeping them guessing they will think you’re more interesting than you really are! |03-23-2014|virgo
109|If you let fear get the better of you today you could miss out on something that would have been a lot of fun – and might even have made you a lot of money. You really have nothing to be anxious about, so take a few risks.|03-24-2014|virgo
110|Something will go out of your life over the next few days and you must not try to cling on to it. The planets suggest that something even better will appear to take its place around the time of next weekend’s new moon.|03-25-2014|virgo
111|Joint plans are less likely to go wrong today if you keep any doubts you have to yourself. Yes, it’s quite likely you can see a better way of doing things but, having agreed to take part in a venture, you must be positive about it.|03-26-2014|virgo
112|You will find it easy to express yourself today and, more importantly, others will find it easy to understand you. If you are involved in a creative pursuit of some kind this is also a good time to impress important people with your skills.|03-27-2014|virgo
113|You are in a rebellious mood at the moment and may well do something that shocks both your friends and your enemies. That’s good. Too many people have been taking you for granted of late. Do something that shakes them up a bit.|03-28-2014|virgo
114|By all means give someone the benefit of the doubt but if your sixth sense warns you are being cheated maybe you should be a bit more cautious. It could be you have been too generous. Sadly, not everyone can be trusted.|03-29-2014|virgo
115|If someone makes you a financial offer on Monday or Tuesday you may be tempted to take it but the planets indicate that an even better deal will be available later in the week, so bide your time. Why rush? You’re not desperate. |03-30-2014|virgo
116|You are advised to hold fire and not be too pushy over the next 24 hours. No matter how ambitious a Virgo you may be there is only so much you can do in any one day, so conserve your energy for when you most need it.|03-31-2014|virgo
117|Others will be generous with you if you are generous with them. Let friends and colleagues know you are willing to work alongside them not just for your benefit but for the benefit of everyone. Teamwork is essential now, in all areas.|04-01-2014|virgo
118|By all means enjoy life today but try not to be so free and easy with your cash. Spending money may not be a problem for you now but it will be later when there is something you want to buy and you cannot afford it.|04-02-2014|virgo
119|If there is someone you would like to know better, most likely with a view to romance, let them see you are interested. If you make the right sort of move now it could be the start of a beautiful friendship – and maybe much more!|04-03-2014|virgo
120|A relationship that has caused you a few sleepless nights will start to improve as from the weekend but don’t think that means you no longer have to work at it. According to the planets this may be the last chance you’ll get.|04-04-2014|virgo
121|You are highly motivated at the moment and that can only be good. Attack difficult tasks with energy and enthusiasm and before you know it your workload will be behind you – then you’ll have the rest of the weekend to have fun.|04-05-2014|virgo
122|The more you want to do things one way the more others want to do them another way and the potential for conflict is clear. However, on this occasion it may be more beneficial to give in, at least where family and money matters are concerned.|04-06-2014|virgo
123|If you need financial assistance now is a good time to ask. Friends and family will do what they can to help you out of a tricky situation but they will also want to be sure you won’t go and get yourself into a similar situation again.|04-07-2014|virgo
124|Actions speak louder than words and because you have something to prove you won’t hesitate to make things happen over the next 24 hours. Not everyone will be happy that you have disturbed the status quo but for you it will be worth it.|04-08-2014|virgo
125|If someone is critical of your work today don’t let it get to you. Either they don’t know what they are talking about or they are trying to make a small flaw or failing look much bigger than it actually is. Just ignore them.|04-09-2014|virgo
126|You seem to have a phobia about something that at most other times would not worry you in the slightest. This sense of fear and uncertainty may continue for a few days yet – but come the start of next week you’ll be all smiles again.|04-10-2014|virgo
127|You seem to be in everyone’s good books at the moment, which for some crazy reason makes you suspicious. The simple fact is some people like you for who you are, so stop being negative and start enjoying the attention.|04-11-2014|virgo
128|Not everyone is as honest as you, so be on your guard when people whose motives you are unsure about make promises you have no way of knowing if they can keep. Before you give them what they desire make sure they pay you first!|04-12-2014|virgo
129|If something you are working on does not seem to be going too well don’t lose heart, and certainly don’t give up on it. A week from now the cosmic picture will change and suddenly it will start going right for you. Be patient, and persistent.|04-13-2014|virgo
130|The message of the stars this week is that you must not start anything you may not be able to finish. Likewise, don’t make promises you may not be able to keep. If you don’t aim so high you’ll look good when you do more.|04-14-2014|virgo
131|Be extra careful when dealing with money matters and business issues. Anything that sounds too good to be true most likely is, so don’t let your enthusiasm get the better of you and check everything you hear, even from trusted sources.|04-15-2014|virgo
132|This is still not a good time for making decisions to do with money or property or investments. If you give yesterday’s eclipse a few days to wane you may find that what you thought was a good deal was in fact nothing of the sort.|04-16-2014|virgo
133|If you promised to do something for a friend and now find you’ve had a change of heart, well too bad! If you let even one person down today your reputation for trustworthiness will quickly head south. Do what you said you would.|04-17-2014|virgo
134|Make life easier for yourself today by taking nothing too seriously. Don’t focus on winning, focus on having a good time and, in the process, learning what you can about other people. You may find they are not so very different to you.|04-18-2014|virgo
135|The restrictions that have held you back in recent weeks will disappear over the next 48 hours but that is not an invitation to go on a spree. Don’t waste your time, energy or money on things that matter little in the greater scheme of things.|04-19-2014|virgo
136|Your confidence may be on a high now but don’t get carried away. The Sun in Taurus puts a rosy glow on things but other influences warn there may be things going on behind the scenes that could upset your plans. Proceed with caution.|04-20-2014|virgo
137|There is a chance you will fall out with someone in a position of authority today, and the results could be messy. If it’s not possible to stay out of their way at least promise yourself that you won’t react when they say something stupid.|04-21-2014|virgo
138|It’s not often a Virgo is easily parted from their cash but the current cosmic set-up warns that’s a real possibility today. Never doubt there are plenty of people out there who would like to get rich at your expense. Don’t let it happen.|04-22-2014|virgo
139|This is one of the best times of the year for you and it will get even better over the next few days as Mercury, your ruler, opens your mind to new possibilities. You may have to travel far to find happiness but you’ll do whatever it takes.|04-23-2014|virgo
140|You want to take a trip but have no valid reason for traveling. So what? Cosmic activity in the most adventurous area of your chart urges you to let your impulses guide you. You can’t help but end up some place that’s fun.|04-24-2014|virgo
141|If you make an effort to reach out to those you love this will be a thoroughly enjoyable day. Some people may be of the opinion that you lack the human touch but obviously they don’t know you too well. Prove them wrong.|04-25-2014|virgo
142|You will be thinking deeply about your life this weekend and the conclusions you reach will have a profound effect on the way you look at and deal with the world. Something else you will realize: we don’t ever truly stop learning.|04-26-2014|virgo
143|It seems you are on a winning streak at the moment and it will get even better over the next few days. Whatever you put your mind to now will work out perfectly, so imagine great things – and let your big heart guide you.|04-27-2014|virgo
144|You may not be entirely convinced that what you are about to do is going to succeed but you have promised others that you will try and you can’t let them down. If it does go wrong at least they are unlikely to ask you again!|04-28-2014|virgo
145|Voices may be raised over the next 24 hours but if you adopt the right attitude it will pass by and leave you unscathed. What you need most right now is a sense of humor, the kind that can laugh at life’s silly little ups and downs.|04-29-2014|virgo
146|Accusations of one sort or another will fly thick and fast today but none of the mud that is thrown will stick to you. It’s not that you are whiter-than-white – you just know how to disguise what you do better than most people!|04-30-2014|virgo
147|The planets are very much in your favor at the moment and no doubt you fear nothing, but you still need to be careful. Don’t push your luck and don’t push yourself beyond your natural limits, no matter what the potential rewards might be.|05-01-2014|virgo
148|You may be practical by nature but you are allowed to dream too and the planets suggest that one particular dream is very close to coming true. Go all out today and over the weekend to push past any remaining obstructions.|05-02-2014|virgo
149|If there is something you need to say that you know friends and family members won’t be happy with then say it now and get it over with. You may be a nice guy by nature but sometimes even a Virgo has to play hardball.|05-03-2014|virgo
150|If you have done something wrong and know you will get found out sooner or later then maybe you should own up straight away. Whatever your transgression maybe others will want to forgive you, so be repentant and make it easy for them.|05-04-2014|virgo
151|A family matter you thought had been resolved will rear its ugly head again today and this time you must make sure it is settled. You may not like having to lay down the law but if you don’t the issue will continue to nag at you.|05-05-2014|virgo
152|It’s time to get working on something of a creative nature that you have been thinking about for quite some time. It will take a great deal of effort, both physical and mental, but it will be a success – that’s a promise from the stars!|05-06-2014|virgo
153|You won’t lack for opportunities today but don’t just throw yourself at the first one that comes along. Identify what it is you most want to accomplish and wait for the right offer or opening – the universe will send it to you very soon.|05-07-2014|virgo
154|You have absolutely nothing to worry about but for some strange reason you have this feeling of impending disaster. Ignore it. Most likely it is just your mind playing tricks on you – and even if it isn’t, what happens will be no big deal.|05-08-2014|virgo
155|Don’t change anything for the sake of it today because you will only have to change it back again later. It might be better to stick with what you know about, even if it is not what you want. Wait and see what the weekend brings.|05-09-2014|virgo
156|Without doubt this is one of the best times of the year for you but don’t let your joy for life lead you to do things that might not be good for you in the long-term. Know your limits, physically, mentally and emotionally, and stay within them.|05-10-2014|virgo
157|You will hear something that you can, if you wish, turn to your advantage, but is it the right thing to do? If you are told something in confidence or overhear a secret that was not meant for your ears it may not be right to make use of it.|05-11-2014|virgo
158|Don’t try to keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself today because loved ones and colleagues will be able to read on your face what it is you are hiding. You must be totally honest about what is going on in your head and your heart.|05-12-2014|virgo
159|You will find that a number of questions you have been asking over the past few weeks will answer themselves over the next 48 hours. Whether or not the answers are to your liking at least you will know what it all means.|05-13-2014|virgo
160|Don’t let anyone convince you that your ideas are of no value and that your beliefs are wrong. Today’s full moon will muddy waters and make you wonder what is fact and what is fiction but you can always trust your inner voice.|05-14-2014|virgo
161|Make it a priority to kiss and make up with someone you fell out with a while back. Most likely you are genuinely sorry you got angry about something that, with hindsight, looks absurdly trivial. You’ll both get over it.|05-15-2014|virgo
162|This is an important time for you, especially if you have big ambitions. Don’t worry if you are still not decided what you should be aiming for in life because the next few days will narrow down your options and make it easier to choose.|05-16-2014|virgo
163|You will be somewhat outspoken over the next 48 hours, which is fine, but don’t get carried away and start bringing up issues that others thought had been dealt with weeks, months, even years ago. It’s time you got over them.|05-17-2014|virgo
164|The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart this week will bring new opportunities and make you aware of possibilities you may not have noticed until now. Before you know it you’ll be on your way to the top. It’s where you belong.|05-18-2014|virgo
165|This will be a busy day and if you are not careful you could tire yourself out rushing here, there and everywhere. Keep your workload to a minimum and keep your aims in perspective. What will it all mean one hundred years from now?|05-19-2014|virgo
166|It may seem as if a dream of some kind is not going to come true but more likely the planets are making you wait a bit so that when the things you desire eventually come your way you will appreciate them more. That’s not so bad.|05-20-2014|virgo
167|You have been waiting in the shadows long enough. Now is the hour when you step out into the world and claim your spot center stage. The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart will encourage you to be more ambitious.|05-21-2014|virgo
168|If you want to make an impression on people in positions of power now is the time to make your move. The Sun in the career area of your chart urges you to do something drastic, something that makes others sit up and take notice.|05-22-2014|virgo
169|Over the next few days you will get the chance to put some of your big ideas to the test. One of those ideas could turn your life around and send you off in a direction you never even considered before. Don’t be afraid to take risks.|05-23-2014|virgo
170|You will throw caution to the wind over the next 48 hours and that’s a good thing. Success to one degree or another is guaranteed and the more you put yourself out there the more you will enjoy yourself. What’s not to like!|05-24-2014|virgo
171|Think seriously about your ambitions. Would you like to change them in some way? If so, now is the time to make your plans and let others know that you are serious about changing your life. You may be surprised how supportive they are.|05-25-2014|virgo
172|People in positions of power will make demands on you over the next few days that you may find hard to meet. The most important thing is that you stay calm and keep your mind free of fear. Always think logically and always act quickly.|05-26-2014|virgo
173|If you are in any way dissatisfied with your lot, now is the time to do something about it. The approaching new moon means that changes are good for you, especially those to do with your career. You will soon be moving up in the world.|05-27-2014|virgo
174|A new moon in the career area of your chart will give you the courage and confidence you need to make necessary changes on the work front. Remember: it’s your life, it’s your career and it’s your choice as to what you do with them both.|05-28-2014|virgo
175|Money may be important to you but it must not be allowed to come ahead of more important things such as love and laughter. Don’t think about what you own and earn, think about what motivates you and makes you smile.|05-29-2014|virgo
176|You have built up so much momentum in recent weeks that you will be moving onward and upward for some time yet. Having said that, you know you cannot keep up this pace forever, so at least start thinking about slowing down.|05-30-2014|virgo
177|With the Sun on excellent terms with Mars this weekend there is precious little you cannot achieve once you set your mind to it. Early next week the omens won’t be quite so good, so take advantage of any and all opportunities now.|05-31-2014|virgo
178|Whatever you do over the next few days some people are sure to criticize you for it, so close your ears and do it anyway. Fortunately, you rather enjoy doing things you know will cause waves – it’s one of your main pleasures in life!|06-01-2014|virgo
179|Keep your plans to yourself today. The less others know about what you are up to the better. You don’t have to be dishonest about it but you do have to realize that there are people out there who don’t want to see you succeed.|06-02-2014|virgo
180|You have big ambitions and you have what it takes to reach the top. However, the planets warn if you act in haste you will repent at your leisure, so don’t be too eager to follow your dream – it could turn into a nightmare.|06-03-2014|virgo
181|You are determined to do something different, something out of the ordinary, and that’s great. But you need to get started on it immediately because come the weekend, when Mercury turns retrograde, all sorts of obstacles will be placed in your way.|06-04-2014|virgo
182|It may feel as if you are under the thumb both at home and at work and no doubt it’s true, but there is no point getting stressed about it. Sit tight and wait for the cosmic outlook to change, which it should do any day now.|06-05-2014|virgo
183|You will have to fight for your rights today, both at home and at work. If you don’t, if you let others eat away at your privileges, you may have none left by the time of the full moon on the 13th. Give as good as you get!|06-06-2014|virgo
184|It may seem as if so much is going wrong in the world but in the greater scheme of things most of it doesn’t matter. There is a plan behind it all and if you look for it today you may catch a glimpse of the bigger picture.|06-07-2014|virgo
185|You need to prepare yourself mentally for some kind of setback. The good news is that in the long-term you will be glad you were forced to cut back on your objectives, though for now you’ll be annoyed you can’t have things all your own way. |06-08-2014|virgo
186|With Neptune beginning one of its retrograde phases in your opposite sign today you may be a bit confused about what others expect of you. That’s okay, because chances are they don’t know themselves. Do what feels right to you, nothing more.|06-09-2014|virgo
187|Today’s lunar eclipse of Saturn makes you feel you are to blame for other people’s problems but there is no logical reason why that should be so. The fact is the more they try to hold you responsible the more likely it is to be their fault!|06-10-2014|virgo
188|Someone you have not seen for a while will come back into your life over the next 24 hours. You may still be a bit sore that they walked out on you without reason or explanation but let it pass. You were made to be together.|06-11-2014|virgo
189|If you want to get the most from the day you are advised to focus your energy in a single direction and put less important matters on the back burner for a while. If you crave success – and you do – you have got to be ruthless.|06-12-2014|virgo
190|Because today’s full moon cuts across such a powerful angle of your chart you must be ready for those around you to overreact in some way. On the home front, especially, there will be times when logic goes right out the window.|06-13-2014|virgo
191|Mars in the money area of your chart will inspire you to make more of your talents over the days and weeks to come. You may be easygoing by nature but no way should you ever accept less than you are worth, financially at least.|06-14-2014|virgo
192|If you try to wriggle out of a commitment this week you will do your reputation a great deal of harm. If you promised to do something for a relative or a friend and now find that you don’t want to do it, well, that’s just too bad.|06-15-2014|virgo
193|When the Sun moves into one of the more positive areas of your chart next weekend you can speak up and let powerful people know why you oppose them. For now though you are advised to bite your tongue and let others do the talking.|06-16-2014|virgo
194|If you see that a friend or relative needs help then step up to the plate and do what you can for them. Some people find it hard to ask for assistance – they think it’s a sign of weakness. Take the pressure off them by making the first move.|06-17-2014|virgo
195|Socially and romantically this is one of the best times of the year for you, so put your chores on hold and don’t let anyone burst the bubble of optimism and happiness that surrounds you. Your positive attitude will attract like-minded people.|06-18-2014|virgo
196|A relationship will come under pressure today and if you say or do the wrong thing it may even come to an end. Tomorrow, inevitably, you will regret having been so brutally outspoken but chances are it needed to happen.|06-19-2014|virgo
197|By all means plan something new but don’t start on it yet. When the Sun changes signs tomorrow it’s quite likely you will become aware of a better way to reach your aims and fulfill your desires. There’s no rush, so take your time.|06-20-2014|virgo
198|There are certain beliefs and ideals you will never give up on or compromise and that’s good. However, circumstances always change and sometimes you need to change with them. Allow yourself to bend a bit this weekend, though not too much.|06-21-2014|virgo
199|Be on your guard as the new week begins because the planets warn not everyone you think is a friend can be trusted. Don’t take chances and don’t give anyone the authority to make decisions for you – that’s asking for trouble.|06-22-2014|virgo
200|Venus, planet of harmony, crosses the career angle of your chart today, so you should find it a whole lot easier to get your way with people in positions of power. By the end of the day they will be eating out of your hand.|06-23-2014|virgo
201|You will get several interesting offers over the next few days. How will you know which of them are right for you? Just listen to your inner voice and follow what it tells you to do. You already know all the important answers.|06-24-2014|virgo
202|There is nothing wrong with having power but if you’ve got it you must make sure you use it in the right way. Bear that thought in mind today. Don’t use power or position to take what you are not really entitled to.|06-25-2014|virgo
203|You will get the proverbial offer you cannot refuse today but if you are smart that is exactly what you will do. The planets indicate that there will be better offers coming your way before the end of the week – and lots of them.|06-26-2014|virgo
204|Today’s new moon suggests that you can, if you wish, take a leadership role in group activities. Others will follow you willingly if you are in turn willing to take more responsibility. Lead from the front – it’s where you should be.|06-27-2014|virgo
205|The most important thing this weekend is that you stay calm, no matter what happens. Also, if you can learn to take yourself a bit less seriously you won’t get so angry with people and your successes will outnumber your failures.|06-28-2014|virgo
206|Find a quiet place away from the chaos of everyday life and let your inner voice speak to you. Stop searching so hard for answers in the world out there and turn your attention inward for a change. Your higher self knows what you need.|06-29-2014|virgo
207|The planets indicate that people in authority will look on you favorably over the next few days, so keep doing what you are doing and make sure you do it with a smile. The harder you work now the more you will be rewarded later on.|06-30-2014|virgo
208|Approach what you have to do today with energy and enthusiasm. Not only will you make an excellent job of it but people in positions of authority will mark you down as someone to watch. Remember, genius is about taking infinite care.|07-01-2014|virgo
209|What seemed so difficult a short while ago now seems the simplest thing of all, which just goes to show how a change of attitude can lead to a change of fortune. Prove to the world you are a force to be reckoned with again.|07-02-2014|virgo
210|Put chores and responsibilities out of your mind and focus on what makes you feel good about yourself. Think of the dreams you had and the plans you made and give yourself a pat on the back for coming so far so quickly.|07-03-2014|virgo
211|What happens over the next 24 hours will bring you down to earth with a bump but maybe that’s a good thing. According to the planets your head has been up there in the clouds a bit too long. It’s time to come back to reality.|07-04-2014|virgo
212|Because tomorrow’s Moon-Mars link takes place in the money area of your chart you need to be careful with your cash. No matter how pretty something may look and no matter how much you desire it, the fact is you cannot afford it.|07-05-2014|virgo
213|You will be hugely ambitious over the next few days and there is every likelihood you will accomplish something truly remarkable. You are right to be proud of yourself but don’t let it go to your head. Remember you’re a down-to-earth Virgo.|07-06-2014|virgo
214|You can make yourself happy or you can make yourself sad – the choice is yours alone. The effort that goes into being depressed can just as easily be diverted into finding things in life that delight you. There are plenty of them.|07-07-2014|virgo
215|You will have to be firm with someone today but you will also let them know that if they stick with you they will get their fair share of the glory. You’re the kind of person who believes in spreading good fortune around.|07-08-2014|virgo
216|If you have fallen behind in your workload now is the time to catch up. The planets will give you the energy to get things done but take care you don’t go too far and work yourself, or others, into the ground.|07-09-2014|virgo
217|There are times when you wonder if certain people are really on your side and it may tempt you to go it alone. But that is not a good idea. No matter how tough and how independent you may be you are going to need allies.|07-10-2014|virgo
218|Sometimes you can be a bit too suspicious for your own good and the planets warn if you take too negative a view of other people’s motives today you could miss out on something worth having. Have the courage to take a few risks.|07-11-2014|virgo
219|This is no time to hold back or fear the future because almost anything is possible for you now – but you need to believe in yourself. If you act on your hunches this weekend you may be surprised how much you accomplish.|07-12-2014|virgo
220|If someone comes to you with a sob story this week you will, unusually, be ready to listen and maybe even to help. But you must still keep your wits about you because there will always be serious con artists out there.|07-13-2014|virgo
221|You may be a bit apprehensive about some of the changes now taking place but the planets indicate if you go with the flow and trust your instincts nothing bad will happen. On the contrary, these changes are designed to make life more rewarding.|07-14-2014|virgo
222|You need to take care when dealing with money matters and business issues in fact there are few people you can trust 100 percent. Whatever else you do or don’t do today don’t let anyone make important financial decisions for you.|07-15-2014|virgo
223|Forget about all the things that have gone wrong in your life and look forward to all the things that will soon be going right. The more you have struggled in recent months the more you will accomplish before the end of the year.|07-16-2014|virgo
224|You may have strong opinions on certain subjects but you need to remember that not everyone sees things the same way as you. Make an effort to find out what other people think – and, more importantly, why they think that way.|07-17-2014|virgo
225|If you need assistance of any sort today you must ask for it, because you don’t have to do it all on your own. You have friends – good friends – who will be more than happy to help you out. So make use of them.|07-18-2014|virgo
226|You are not the sort to let other people’s doubts stop you and that’s good because you will encounter some negative reactions today. The more others tell you that what you are planning is doomed the more you will try to prove them wrong.|07-19-2014|virgo
227|As the Sun moves into the most sensitive area of your chart this week you may be a bit touchy – make that a lot if you are the touchy sort anyway. You won’t do yourself any favors if you let your temper get the better of you.|07-20-2014|virgo
228|You may not be much in the mood for routine activities today but the planets insist that you make a serious effort to catch up on the backlog of jobs you never quite got around to over the previous few weeks. That means now!|07-21-2014|virgo
229|The next few weeks won’t always be easy but that does not mean they have to be hard. A lot will depend on your attitude, especially your willingness to rise to challenges rather than be intimidated by them. Treat life as a game a game to be won.|07-22-2014|virgo
230|You may have a brilliant idea but don’t do anything with it just yet. File it away in the back of your mind and let it simmer for a while. When you come back to it later on it will have matured and you will be ready to act.|07-23-2014|virgo

232|There is nothing anyone can do to harm you, so stop worrying. You may see enemies in every nook and cranny but most of them exist in your imagination only, so get a grip on yourself and start getting important things done.|07-25-2014|virgo
233|You may look calm on the outside but on the inside you are a raging inferno and what happens over the next 48 hours will bring your feelings to the boil. That’s good. It isn’t healthy to keep all that emotion bottled up inside.|07-26-2014|virgo
234|You will be a lot less fearful over the coming week about the path your life appears to be taking. You won’t, of course, overcome all your anxieties at once but as from now you will look on the bright side more often than not.|07-27-2014|virgo

240|You will have to put up with people who, for one reason or another, don’t want to see you succeed. As a general rule the more others criticize you over the next 48 hours the more sure you can be that you are doing the right thing.|08-02-2014|virgo

244|You seem to be interested in all sorts of strange ideas and some people are beginning to worry about the state of your mind. They need not be concerned, you are just going through one of those rebellious phases when you refuse to be logical.|08-06-2014|virgo
245|Someone, will feel the sharp edge of your tongue today, and no doubt they deserve it, but later you may have second thoughts and wish you had not been quite so scathing. Don’t apologize but let them know it’s now over and done with.|08-07-2014|virgo

248|It’s not often you get emotional but you will do this week. Hopefully you will succeed in controlling yourself because if you blow your top you may offend someone important. Okay, so they may deserve it but don’t forget who has the power.|08-10-2014|virgo
249|According to the planets you have nothing to fear, except maybe missing out on a great opportunity if you continue to hesitate. If you’re attracted to someone you must let them know. Chances are they feel the same way about you.|08-11-2014|virgo
250|Less than two weeks from now a new solar year will begin and you will no longer be held back by issues over which you have no control. Stay calm and keep smiling but be patient too. The good times are on their way.|08-12-2014|virgo
251|Don’t worry too much if you fall out with someone today, because you’ll be friends again before you know it. Everything seems more important than it actually is at the moment, so try not to take anything too seriously, including yourself.|08-13-2014|virgo
252|You won’t let little things like work and domestic commitments hold you back today. As far as you are concerned it’s okay to have fun – in fact it’s demanded. That’s what you believe and you intend to be true to it!|08-14-2014|virgo
253|Mercury, your ruler, moves into your birth sign today, making it so much easier to work out what it is you want out of life. Once you have decided, make your plans and then act at the earliest opportunity. Don’t hesitate.|08-15-2014|virgo

255|Whatever else you do over the next few days don’t give in to negative emotions. Life is better than you think it is and is about to get better still. Be patient. The Sun’s move into your sign on the 23rd will change everything.|08-17-2014|virgo
256|You have never been the sort to run away from problems and you must not start thinking that way now. Get together with people whose outlook on life inspires you and soon your problems, such as they are, will no longer exist.|08-18-2014|virgo
257|Your first instincts are usually the right instincts, so trust them and refuse to change what you are doing just because those around you are having second thoughts. Listen to what your inner voice tells you. It knows all the answers.|08-19-2014|virgo
258|You may be finding it hard to keep up with certain developments but who says you have to? Stay where you are and don’t start anything new today. You will get your chance to shine when the Sun enters your sign on the 23rd.|08-20-2014|virgo
259|A new solar year begins for you in 48 hours time and if you wan to get it off to a flying start you must clear as much junk out of your life as is humanly possible. Nevermind that it has sentimental value – get rid of it.|08-21-2014|virgo

262|A new moon in your sign on Monday means that all things are possible, even more so as Mercury, your ruler, is also strong in your chart. Put a name to your dream and before the week is over you will be moving towards it at high speed.|08-24-2014|virgo

264|There is no reason at all why you should be feeling depressed because everything is going right for you now. If you really can’t see that then maybe you need to shift your perspective. Don’t look back with regret. Look forward with anticipation.|08-27-2014|virgo

266|A Sun-Neptune link on your birthday means you need to balance the two sides of your nature – the logical and the emotional. Try seeing each and every situation from multiple angles. The deeper you look the more meaning you will discover.|08-29-2014|virgo
267|There is no point arguing the toss with people who always seem to take the opposite view to your own. It really does not matter what other people think about what you believe – if it works for you it has to be right.|08-30-2014|virgo
268|A problem you thought was too tough to solve will turn out to have a simple solution and when you see it at last you will laugh to think you made such a big deal of it. Next time, don’t take yourself so seriously. |08-31-2014|virgo
269|What you need to accept now is that if you are going to be successful, in any arena, you have to take a few risks. Playing safe is no longer an option. Your dreams requires a full-blooded commitment to enterprise and excellence. Go for it.|09-01-2014|virgo
270|If you feel the need to reorder your home life in some way then by all means do so but don’t go making changes that cost a lot of money. There is a lot you can do for free, all it requires is that you get yourself organized.|09-02-2014|virgo

273|With Venus moving into your sign on your birthday you should breeze through the coming year. But don’t get so laid back about life that you ease off too much and fail to complete what you started. A creative talent is there to be used – and profited from.|09-05-2014|virgo
274|Your situation is not nearly as bad as you think it is and over the next 48 hours you will do much better than you expected. Something related to money or legal matters will work itself out in your favor, so why worry?|09-06-2014|virgo

276|Success can be yours over the coming 12 months but you are more likely to get the rewards you crave if you stop making plans and let life come to you. Like all Virgos you tend to think too much, but there’s no need – the universe knows what you want.|09-08-2014|virgo

278|You must not ignore a loved one’s feelings today, not even if you think they are getting emotional for no good reason. You can and you must show some sensitivity. The fact is not everyone is as rational and logically minded as you.|09-10-2014|virgo
279|The Sun and Saturn combine on your birthday to remind you of the importance of sticking with your plan. No matter how tempted you may be to change course over the coming 12 months you must go the distance. You’re closer to your goal than you realize.|09-11-2014|virgo
280|You are now perfectly placed to make the kind of changes that are needed to make your life more fulfilling and rewarding. For years you have talked about what you dream of achieving – now it is time to stop dreaming and start doing. Start today.|09-12-2014|virgo
281|You will have to deal with some emotionally volatile people over the next 48 hours. Not everyone shares your logical way of looking at the world, so make allowances and make efforts to calm them down. Alternatively, just stay out of their way.|09-13-2014|virgo
282|Profit is important but principles must always come first. That is the message of the stars on your birthday and if you heed it you will not only do well financially but feel you have made a positive difference too. Always aim for the higher good.|09-14-2014|virgo
283|You may not understand how your mind has arrived at a certain conclusion but deep down you know it is the right one for you. It may seem a bit silly at the present moment but come the end of the week it will make perfect sense.|09-15-2014|virgo
284|For some strange reason you will find it almost impossible to get started today. For a workaholic like you this may be worrying but remember, it’s not the quantity of work you get done that matters but the quality. Do just one thing really well.|09-16-2014|virgo
285|If an idea or a belief or a philosophy appeals to you then by all means explore it further and find ways to incorporate it into your everyday affairs. You will be on a search for meaning over the coming year, and what you discover will transform you.|09-17-2014|virgo
286|You may not be able to take your own plans further at the moment but you can certainly help a friend or relative do something that means a lot to them. Who knows, in return they may find ways to help you make progress too.|09-18-2014|virgo
287|You don’t have to do what others expect you to do. You don’t have to follow a certain course of action just because that’s the way it’s always been done. Dare to be different this year. Dare to try new paths to happiness and success. Make your life an adventure.|09-19-2014|virgo
288|The past few weeks have been immensely enjoyable and the next few days will be a lot of fun as well. An important relationship will grow deeper and stronger, not least because you realize how lucky you are to be loved.|09-20-2014|virgo
289|It is only natural that you should be excited about an offer of some sort but you should know there will be even better offers over the coming week. Keep your nerve and hold out for a better deal – sooner or later you’ll get it.|09-21-2014|virgo
290|Before starting anything new over the next few days remember that your head will have to live with the consequences of what your heart decides. In other words, don’t be hasty. So much is changing now that it will pay you to watch and wait.|09-22-2014|virgo
291|You are well aware that various aspects of your existence need to change and over the coming year you will put in place the foundations of a more exciting and rewarding way of life. But don’t forget who you are. Be yourself, only a better version than before.|09-23-2014|virgo
292|A new moon in the money area of your chart means you can easily find ways to pay what you owe. You have never been a slacker when it comes to hard work and you may have to take on a second job for a while.|09-24-2014|virgo
293|If you try to talk your way out of trouble today chances are you won’t succeed. If, however, you come clean and admit you made a mistake you will be forgiven with no questions asked. Honesty is always the best policy.|09-25-2014|virgo
294|Is everything that is going on in your life really as simple as it seems? According to the planets there are things going on behind the scenes of which you are only vaguely aware. Keep your eyes and ears open over the next 24 hours.|09-26-2014|virgo
295|Try not to identify too strongly with what you own and what you earn. As Mercury leaves the money area of your chart this weekend it may be that you have to accept a loss of some sort but it’s no big deal. It’s only bits of paper.|09-27-2014|virgo
296|You need to focus your life in a new direction, a direction more in keeping with your natural desires and talents. Make that your objective for the coming week and, when you feel the time is right, make a truly decisive move.|09-28-2014|virgo
297|Make the effort to get out and about and visit people and places you have not seen in a while. The more you are on the move today the more likely it is you will make contacts who could be useful both personally and professionally.|09-29-2014|virgo
298|A complicated and confusing situation will get even more complicated and confusing over the next 24 hours, so the best thing you can do is to put it out of your mind and focus on something else. You don’t need to know all the answers.|09-30-2014|virgo
299|Today’s powerful cosmic activity means you can, if you wish, force your will on other people. It may be the profitable thing to do but is it the right thing to do? Act only in ways that are likely to keep you on good terms with everyone.|10-01-2014|virgo
300|You don’t like to see people you care for make fools of themselves but it seems they are pretty determined about it, so what can you do? Help them if you can but remember that people learn best from making their own mistakes.|10-02-2014|virgo
301|You would like to forgive someone who has made a mistake but you know if you do they will most likely make the same mistake again. This is one of those occasions when you need to act tough, even though you don’t really feel it.|10-03-2014|virgo
302|Something you have been dreaming of for quite some time is about to come true but with it will come a level of responsibility you may not have expected. The fact is you can’t have one without the other, so take the rough with the smooth.|10-04-2014|virgo
303|You know what it is you desire and you know that if you focus on it to the exclusion of everything else you will get it. Financially things could go either way over the next few days but it’s not really about money, it’s about passion.|10-05-2014|virgo
304|An awkward situation won’t seem quite so awkward once the lunar eclipse in midweek has done its work, but between now and then you must tread carefully when dealing with certain people. They will take just about anything you say the wrong way.|10-06-2014|virgo
305|Work hard today but don’t go to extremes. There are only so many hours in a day, even for a Virgo, and those hours will be more productive if you pace yourself sensibly and don’t try to do everything at once. Be kind to yourself.|10-07-2014|virgo
306|What happens today is likely to throw your arrangements into confusion, but it’s probably not as bad as it seems. Unseen forces are maneuvering you in a new direction, a direction that will ultimately make your life richer and more fulfilling.|10-08-2014|virgo
307|You may have misgivings about a deal of some kind but you would be wise to ignore them. What happens over the next few days should give you a new sense of confidence in what you are doing and where you are going.|10-09-2014|virgo
308|There are occasions, and this is one of them, when your emotions must be ignored and you act on logic and reason alone. Today’s cosmic picture signifies that a practical problem requires a practical solution – so don’t let personal feelings get in the way.|10-10-2014|virgo
309|You may be at a loss to explain how or why something happened but don’t dwell on it too long. Even if there is no rational explanation the fact is circumstances have changed and the world has moved on – and you need to move on too.|10-11-2014|virgo
310|There may be one or two people who disagree with what you are doing but they don’t count. The only things that matter now are that you know what it is you are aiming for and that you know where and how to get it. So get going.|10-12-2014|virgo
311|A relationship that has been a source of endless aggravation in recent weeks will transform itself into something much nicer over the next few days. Come the end of the month you will look back and realize how fortunate you have been.|10-13-2014|virgo
312|Refuse to be hurried today. The more others try to move you along the more you should dig in your heels and demand to know why they are in such a rush. There is no law that says you have to go faster just to benefit them financially.|10-14-2014|virgo
313|The message of the cosmos is quite straightforward: focus only on what you are good at. It does not matter if it has a practical application or if it is going to make you money, now or in the future. It matters only that you enjoy it.|10-15-2014|virgo
314|If life seems to be getting a bit too complicated it is probably because you are involved in too many things. Mercury, your ruling planet, urges you to focus your energies in one particular direction today rather than spread yourself too thin.|10-16-2014|virgo
315|The positive results of the decisions you made a few weeks ago will be apparent over the next two or three days. No effort or sacrifice is ever wasted, so stop feeling sorry for yourself and enjoy what the future has in store for you.|10-17-2014|virgo
316|Give voice to what you think and feel over the coming week and don’t worry in the slightest that some people might be offended. The planets indicate that straight talking is needed if you are to get past disputes that do no one any good.|10-19-2014|virgo
317|Think deeply about what you are doing and where you are going. Not that you are doing anything wrong or going in the wrong direction but it’s sensible to take stock once in a while, if only to make sure you get the best from yourself.|10-20-2014|virgo
318|The Sun’s change of signs on Thursday, accompanied by a powerful eclipse, means you are about to embark on a highly positive phase. There is every reason to feel optimistic about the future – well, your future anyway – so cheer up.|10-21-2014|virgo
319|You may think you know everything there is to know about someone but what happens today and tomorrow will make you realize that there is more to them than meets the eye. Of course, it’s no big deal – much the same could be said about you.|10-22-2014|virgo
320|Although your money situation may still be difficult, you will be less inclined to worry now that the Sun is moving out of the financial area of your chart. What matters is having fun and you can have plenty of it at almost no cost at all.|10-23-2014|virgo
321|No matter how emotionally draining recent events may have been you are past the worst and now you can see the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. Expect to be rewarded for your efforts and sacrifices today and over the weekend.|10-24-2014|virgo
322|One of the best times of the year is about to begin for you and almost anything you set your heart on over the next few weeks can be yours if you want it enough. Forget about money and relationship worries and focus on the good things in life.|10-25-2014|virgo
323|Be yourself today, no matter how hard others try to persuade you that you can and should change your personality. The fact is you are who you are and what you need for happiness and success is already in your life. Look for it and you’ll find it. |10-26-2014|virgo
324|According to the planets you need to be a bit more assertive and a bit more arrogant in your approach to life. Too often you act as if you believe you don’t deserve to be the one who wins. The fact is few people deserve it more.|10-27-2014|virgo
325|According to the planets you are trying too hard to make sense of what is essentially a simple situation. Whatever else you do today don’t get caught up in petty arguments – save your energy and passion for the really important things.|10-28-2014|virgo
326|If you feel the need to get out and about you must not deny yourself. A change of scene will do you the world of good over the next 24 hours and could even lead to a work or financial opportunity you might otherwise have missed.|10-30-2014|virgo
327|The future is nowhere near as dire as you think it is, so stop looking for reasons why things could go wrong and trust that the universe in its wisdom will show you what needs to be done. Your glass is half full, not half empty.|11-01-2014|virgo
328|You have so many good ideas buzzing around inside you head and if you bring other people in on what you are thinking you could create something amazing together. Remember: success, like genius, is a combination of inspiration and perspiration.|11-02-2014|virgo
329|Deep down you are a little bit uneasy about the direction your life seems to be taking. With that thought in mind don’t start something new today simply because you feel the need for a change. Your progress must be evolutionary, not revolutionary. |11-03-2014|virgo
330|A minor disagreement could escalate with alarming rapidity over the next 24 hours. The sad fact is some people are ridiculously touchy, so watch what you say and how you say it. Ultimately, it might be better to say nothing at all.|11-04-2014|virgo
331|Your assumptions about what is right and what is wrong will be challenged today. Have you been following a certain code of behavior more out of habit than conviction? Yes, you have. You may need to change what you believe in. |11-05-2014|virgo
332|Try not to take anything or anyone, including yourself, too seriously today. Use your imagination to the full, embrace situations that excite your senses and let what happens just happen any way it chooses. The game of life should always be fun.|11-07-2014|virgo
333|You will be confronted with something new today, most likely an idea or a way of looking at life, and to say the least it will intrigue you. Somehow you are going to have to find a way to fit it in with your existing beliefs.|11-08-2014|virgo
334|A situation you thought you had under control is turning out to be more complicated than you anticipated. Be that as it may, in the greater scheme of things it is of only minor importance, so don’t let it wind you up. Relax – and smile more too.|11-09-2014|virgo
335|Today’s Mars-Pluto link in the most creative area of your chart will help you get some sort of project off the ground. Just take care you don’t move ahead too quickly or your resources will soon run dry. Move in the right direction a step at a time.|11-10-2014|virgo
336|The world looks a brighter place than it did a week or two ago and you have every reason to expect that the good times will keep getting better. Your optimistic frame of mind will make even the most difficult of issues easier to deal with. |11-11-2014|virgo
337||11-12-2014|virgo
338|The planets urge you to face up to what worries you the most. You may be surprised to discover that, not only was there nothing to be scared of, but what you have been trying to avoid is actually quite exciting.|11-13-2014|virgo
339|You may be able to see where loved ones are going wrong but unless they specifically ask for your assistance you are advised to keep your distance. If you interfere without first being invited you will cause more problems than you solve.|11-14-2014|virgo
340|Make sure you know what is at stake before embarking on a project of some kind. If those who want to get you involved go out of their way to convince you there is no risk involved then you can be pretty sure there is.|11-15-2014|virgo
341|Some things are easy and some things are difficult but all things are possible. You may have to push yourself a little bit harder than usual this coming week but the tougher the challenge the more you will enjoy it.|11-16-2014|virgo
342|If an amazing idea surfaces in your mind today you must do something with it. Write it down in as much detail as you can straight away – if you have a written record of your thoughts they are less likely to fade. |11-17-2014|virgo
343|You have more in common with a rival than you realize – in fact you are like two peas in a pod. Therefore, instead of fighting each other to a standstill why don’t you pool your resources and work as a team? You will be unbeatable.|11-18-2014|virgo
344|The outcome of a personal dilemma may be in the balance but you are the one whose actions will decide which way it tips. You can be confrontational if you wish but it isn’t necessary. Use your communication skills to bring people together. |11-19-2014|virgo
345|Pretend you have faith in someone’s abilities, even if you doubt they are up to the job. If you say the wrong thing now you may destroy their confidence completely. A little subtle flattery will do wonders for their self-belief, and be good for you too.|11-20-2014|virgo
346|In your mind’s eye you can see what needs to be done to make your life more exciting but actually doing it is another thing entirely. Fortunately, the Sun’s change of signs over the weekend will stir things up – and from confusion will come opportunity.|11-21-2014|virgo
347|An unexpected event will disrupt your weekend and to say the least you won’t be happy about it but there is no point screaming and shouting. Stay calm, go with the flow and accept you can’t always have things your own way. |11-22-2014|virgo
348|The best way possible to handle a dispute is to resolutely refuse to come out in favor of one side or the other. If you play favorites this week you risk making the situation even worse than it was before. Sit on the fence –  it’s what fences are for.|11-23-2014|virgo
349|Your thoughts may be far away but the demands of your current situation will soon bring you back to reality. Work hard and catch up on what you have to do and the latter part of the week will be free for fun and games. |11-24-2014|virgo
350|Don’t limit yourself to one particular environment today – get out into the world and see as much as you possibly can. And don’t try to limit friends and relatives if they are determined to break out and try something new. Encourage them.|11-25-2014|virgo
351|Sit back, relax and give your emotional and physical batteries time to recharge. Today’s Mercury-Saturn link is a reminder that life is meant to be fun – and also a warning that if you do too much you will pay for it eventually. |11-26-2014|virgo
352|Make an effort to think “outside the box” today. Sometimes the mental boundaries you set up are far too rigid and need to be broken down, so give yourself permission to think the unthinkable – you may be surprised what you learn.|11-27-2014|virgo
353|Today’s cosmic influences will offer you the chance to break the deadlock in a long-running dispute. There may have been harsh words flying here, there and everywhere but that is now in the past. The question is: can you now go forward together?|11-28-2014|virgo
354|Upheavals on the home front may be annoying but they can also be helpful, especially if they force family members to sit down and discuss their problems. That means you too: keeping negative feelings to yourself won’t help anyone – make them public. |11-29-2014|virgo
355|You may have to disrupt your routine in order to accommodate someone’s social or travel plans and it’s unlikely you will be happy about it. Never mind. If you show willing and help with a smile chances are you’ll get something in return.|11-30-2014|virgo
356|It may not be obvious where a certain situation is taking you but don’t worry – everything will be revealed in time. Trust your instincts over the next few days and never doubt that you are being watched over by positive forces.  |12-01-2014|virgo
357|The planets urge you to focus not on the things you want but on the things you need – and yes, they are different. Take care of the essentials over the next 24 hours and everything else that happens will seem like a bonus.|12-02-2014|virgo
358|The task you have to set yourself may seem daunting or even impossible but it is only your negative attitude that makes it so. You will succeed beyond your wildest dreams, now and in the future, if you have confidence in your own abilities.|12-03-2014|virgo
359|You must control any tendency you may have to go to extremes, especially when involved in demanding physical and mental activities. Balance in all things will pay dividends – you will still be going strong when others are starting to tire. |12-04-2014|virgo
360|Anyone who thinks you lack the killer instinct will have to revise their opinion now that you have a specific target to aim for. Nothing and no one will be allowed to stand in your way – and if your rivals are smart they will stand aside! |12-05-2014|virgo
361|Feelings will be running high this weekend and you will have to work hard not to let the intensity of the situation get to you. Don’t take what others say too seriously. Most likely they don’t mean it and, even if they do, so what?|12-06-2014|virgo
362|Whatever it is you are currently worried about is actually of little significance in the greater scheme of things, so make an effort to put it out of your mind and focus instead on all the good things, and good people, that remain.|12-07-2014|virgo
363|If you find it hard to get your act in gear as the new week begins maybe you should take it as a sign that you are doing something wrong. Or maybe it just means you need an extra day of rest after the exertions of the weekend! |12-08-2014|virgo
364|You will need a great deal of patience over the next 24 hours, especially when dealing with authority figures. No matter how much they provoke you do not lose your temper. Certainly don’t say anything they could use against you later. |12-09-2014|virgo
365|All things are possible for you now Virgo, so set your sights high and don’t stop until you have reached your goal. You will be amazed how easily things come to you and how readily others are to help you realize your plans.|12-10-2014|virgo
366|Don’t let your work get on top of you. There are many ways you can make life easier for yourself and the most obvious is to stop pushing yourself so hard. Everything that needs to be done will get done in its own good time.|12-11-2014|virgo
367|Yes, there are things going on behind the scenes that you know little about but that does not mean they are bad things. According to the planets you have nothing to fear and lots to look forward to, both in your personal life and at work.|12-12-2014|virgo
368|Try to be more understanding this weekend, especially when dealing with people who are in some way down on their luck. Yes, they may have brought it on themselves but that does not mean you should not help them.|12-13-2014|virgo
369|If you don’t protect your own interests over the next few days you may lose something precious. You know who your rivals are and you know what they are after, so it should be a simple matter to fight your corner.|12-14-2014|virgo
370|You seem to be in one of those moods when you are interested only in extremes and according to the planets you will either do something very good or very bad today – there is no middle ground. Either way you will have fun.|12-15-2014|virgo
371|A loved one will be a little too emotional for your tastes today but if you want some peace you are going to have to help them deal with their issues. It should not be too hard: your analytical mind will find a workable solution.|12-16-2014|virgo
372|It’s a long time since you have felt this good and you should certainly make the most of it. If you have a creative or artistic talent you would like to do something major with, now is the time to get serious about it.|12-17-2014|virgo
373|Someone may try to persuade you that a certain course of action is in your interests but you have your doubts. Listen to your instincts and act on what they tell you. Better still, don’t act at all – doing nothing is the best policy by far. |12-18-2014|virgo
374|Someone will get on your nerves in a big way today and if you make it through to the weekend without losing your cool you will have done very well indeed. Chances are they don’t mean it personally – they’re just panicking a bit.|12-19-2014|virgo
375|The Sun’s change of signs this weekend means you are about to embark on one of the most dynamic and creative times of the year, a time when almost anything is possible. Actually that’s not entirely accurate – scrap the word “almost”! |12-20-2014|virgo
376|This is potentially one of the best weeks of the year for you as tomorrow’s new moon in Capricorn takes your confidence to new heights. What you start over the next few days is sure to be a success – so see it through to the end.|12-21-2014|virgo
377|This is one of the best times of the year for trying new things, both in your personal life and at work. Make the most of today’s new moon to branch out creatively and do things that have never been done before – at least not by you! |12-22-2014|virgo
378|There is so much you want to accomplish but if you are smart you will pace yourself sensibly and set realistic goals, both for this week and for the coming new year. Take each day as it comes and live, as far as possible, in the moment. |12-23-2014|virgo
379|Don’t worry too much if you have fallen out with a loved one. A few days from now you will be the best of friends again, so go your own way until then and don’t take it personally if they don’t seem to care. They do really. |12-24-2014|virgo
380|Watch out you don’t say too much and let others in on a secret that you really should have kept to yourself. Secrets inevitably lose their value when everyone knows about them, so zip your mouth and enjoy being one of the few in the know. |12-25-2014|virgo
381|There is something you want to do with your life but it means giving up so much of what you already know. Is it worth it? Can you do it? These are questions that only you can answer. Start giving it some serious thought. |12-26-2014|virgo
382|Why fight your way to the top when you have the charm to get there by a simpler route? Cosmic activity in your fellow Earth sign of Capricorn makes it easy for you to win others round to your way of thinking. |12-27-2014|virgo
383|You have so many things to be thankful for and if you don’t believe that at this particular moment you will believe it in just a few days. Focus on creative activities and affairs of the heart and you will be smiling well into the new year.|12-28-2014|virgo
384|Why do you find it so hard to believe that this is potentially one of the most exciting and rewarding times of the year? Whatever the reason you need to snap out of it because some wonderful opportunities will come your way this week. |12-29-2014|virgo
385|You will be in an open and outgoing mood today but watch out your passion for life does not get the better of you and you say or do something that you may later regret. Thursday’s Mars-Jupiter link warns of a serious falling-out. |12-30-2014|virgo
386|If you feel tied down by obligations you would prefer not to have then now is the time to do something about it. Resolve to be more independent in 2015. Resolve to put your own needs and dreams first. And mean it! |12-31-2014|virgo
387|Your energy levels may be high but don’t take on extra work. The full moon on the 5th will give rise to various options you had not considered – and you won’t be able to take advantage of them if you have too much on your plate already. |01-01-2015|virgo
388|The next few weeks will be special for you as so many of your long-term plans start to bear fruit. Between now and the 20th, when the Sun changes signs, you will do some extraordinary things – extraordinary by other people’s standards anyway. |01-02-2015|virgo
389|You may be exceptionally busy at the moment but the planets warn you need to slow down a bit, or maybe a lot. You can still get just as much done if you plan your days better and waste less time on trivial things. |01-03-2015|virgo
390|Get back on good terms with someone you have fallen out with. Most likely they will need a shoulder to cry on when the moon is full on Monday and if you are there for them then all will be forgiven. |01-04-2015|virgo
391|You need to get tough with someone who seems to delight in placing obstacles in your path. Don’t make a big scene of it, just let them know that if they can’t be a team player then there is no point in their hanging around. |01-06-2015|virgo
392|Something you have spent months trying to get right will solve itself over the next 24 hours. Don’t spend too much time trying to work out where you went wrong, just accept the situation with gratitude and get on with your life. |01-07-2015|virgo
393|The news you receive over the next 24 hours could be good or it could be bad – it depends entirely on how you choose to look at it. Do you see the glass as half full or half empty? Do you even see the glass? |01-08-2015|virgo
394|You are in one of those moods where you will happily do anything for anyone. Most people will appreciate your kindness but one individual may try to take advantage of it. Be generous by all means but try not to be gullible.|01-10-2015|virgo
395|You could find yourself locked in some kind of dispute during the early part of the week and you will simply refuse to back down. But neither will the other side and you may have no alternative but to bring your partnership to an end. |01-11-2015|virgo
396|Partnerships of one kind or another will feature over the next few days and even if you are the kind of Virgo who prefers to work alone it will pay you to join forces with someone who shares your ambitions. Together you can get it done. |01-12-2015|virgo
397|If you allow yourself to get submerged in details, whether in your personal life or at work, over the next 24 hours you will almost certainly miss something big. Take a few steps back and try to see the bigger picture. |01-13-2015|virgo
398|A little of what you fancy today will do you the world of good. Don’t listen to those who say it is wrong to enjoy yourself when so many others are finding it tough – that’s nonsense. Show the world how easy it is to have fun. |01-14-2015|virgo
399|There is a bit of tension in the air at the moment and partners and colleagues could be difficult to deal with over the next 24 hours. Don’t overreact and say or do things that make matters worse – this is only a passing phase. |01-15-2015|virgo
400|There is something you have wanted to do for many years but for one reason or another never quite got around to. Now the universe is making it easy for you to get started on it. Don’t hesitate – it’s never too late.|01-16-2015|virgo
401|This is an extremely positive time for you and all manner of things are possible. But it is also a time when you may clash with someone in a position of authority. Under no circumstances back down. You have right on your side. |01-17-2015|virgo
402|The Sun moves into one of the more serious areas of your chart in a couple of days time. Does that mean you will no longer have fun? Of course not. But you will have to focus more on work and health issues.|01-18-2015|virgo
403|You take your responsibilities seriously, which is good, but if you focus on them to the exclusion of everything else today you could miss out on a fun time. All work and no play is rarely a good idea, not even for a Virgo.|01-19-2015|virgo
404|The Sun moves from one of the more serious areas of your chart today but that does not mean you can no longer have fun. You will, however, have to focus more on work and health issues over the days and weeks to come. |01-20-2015|virgo
405|If you make a move without asking your partner’s permission today you may never hear the last of it. Whatever you want to do today be smart and clear it with your nearest and dearest first. Anything for a peaceful life! |01-21-2015|virgo
406|Don’t make any hard or fast plans for the next 24 hours because they are sure to change. If a partner or colleague insists that you change direction, agree with them. It will only be an issue if you make it an issue.|01-22-2015|virgo
407|Be careful what you spend your money on today because if you waste it on things you don’t really need you will find yourself short of cash when there is something you do need at the turn of the month. Be frugal.|01-23-2015|virgo
408|If you are not in the mood for work this weekend then don’t force yourself. No matter how urgent the tasks that demand your attention appear to be they can, in fact, be safely put off until the early part of next week. |01-24-2015|virgo
409|Make it easy for others to approach you this coming week, because what they have to say or show you could be of huge importance. Sometimes you put on a fierce face without knowing it and it tends to scare people away. |01-25-2015|virgo
410|This may be a confusing day as the signals you get from colleagues and employers are jumbled to say the least. Your best course of action is to ignore their words and focus on their body language – it will tell you what you need to know. |01-26-2015|virgo
411|You seem prone to silly fears and fantasies at the moment and that could be a problem today. Wherever you go, whatever you do and whoever you deal with rest assured you will be protected, so don’t let your imagination run riot.|01-27-2015|virgo
412|Someone who never seems to stop complaining is beginning to get on your nerves and at some point today you will have to confront them. Let them know in no uncertain terms that you’ve had enough and they should do their whining elsewhere.|01-28-2015|virgo
413|Try not to make a big issue of something that is really quite trivial. If you are having problems on the work front take it as a sign that you are doing something wrong and make the necessary adjustments. Stay calm and make it work. |01-29-2015|virgo
414|According to the planets you can do a lot of people a lot of good but only if you join forces with those who share your opinions and beliefs and focus on the same goals. Yes, you can change the world – if you all act together. |01-30-2015|virgo
415|Don’t try too hard to impress loved ones this weekend because your efforts will most likely be wasted. They have a lot on their minds at the moment so do what you have to do and do it well – but don’t expect lots of praise.|01-31-2015|virgo
416|Be careful what you allow yourself to think this week because your imagination is extremely powerful at the moment. The things you think now will in some way or other come true later on, so be happy and positive at all times.|02-01-2015|virgo
417|Are you inspired by other people’s successes, or do they make you envious? Actually it does not matter which it is because either way it will motivate you to do more yourself. This can be a time of real achievement.|02-02-2015|virgo
418|If you let your worries get out of hand today it may stop you from taking any kind of action and once you stop you will find it hard to get going again. The best way to deal with doubts and fears is to ignore them. |02-03-2015|virgo
419|You seem to be in two minds about what you should be doing. Of course, that is nothing unusual for a Virgo but today is different because you know that you have to make a quick decision, even if it means flipping a coin.|02-04-2015|virgo
420|You seem to believe that everyone is as honest as you. It would be nice if it was true but it isn’t and what happens today will open your eyes to that fact in a big way. Deals of all kinds should always be made in writing. |02-05-2015|virgo
421|You may not be able to get into the swing of things socially today but that’s okay. You need to spend time with your thoughts and once you have made sense of them you will be the life and soul of the party again.|02-06-2015|virgo
422|Put all thoughts of getting back at someone out of your head. Aim to get along with everyone you meet. It does not have to be you against the world. It does not have to be you against anyone. Lighten up, it’s life.|02-07-2015|virgo
423|If someone offers you something for nothing this week you should be suspicious. Almost certainly they want to do you a favor now so they can ask a favor of you later on. That should set alarm bells ringing. You’re being set up. |02-08-2015|virgo
424|If you need to communicate with employers or other important people now is the time. You will find it easy to put across your ideas and make a good impression. But don’t try too hard – make it seem as if it all comes naturally. |02-09-2015|virgo
425|Push ahead with your number one plan, no matter how many people say you must be either mad or bad. The real reason certain people oppose you is that they are scared you will show them up – and they’re right, you will.|02-10-2015|virgo
426|Tie up loose ends and make sure you have not missed any small but important details. Partnerships and relationships will be under increasingly important stars as the month moves on, so clear the decks for action now. |02-11-2015|virgo
427|Don’t push yourself too hard over the next 24 hours. Friends and family members will quite happily share the burden of what you want to do, so spread the load a bit. Work-wise, make this a day of planning rather than doing.|02-13-2015|virgo
428|Some people stick by you through good times and bad but others quit at the first sign of trouble. What happens today will make it clear who your true friends are and it will cheer you to discover that so many want to help you.|02-14-2015|virgo
429|As the Sun moves into the relationship sector of your chart this week you will find it much easier to let partners and loved ones know how you feel. The words you found so hard to say a few days ago will now flow off your tongue. |02-15-2015|virgo
430|Creative activities are under brilliant stars at the moment, as are affairs of the heart. In each of these areas your life will be transformed over the coming week, so be upbeat and be on the lookout for the next big opportunity. |02-16-2015|virgo
431|You may think you know everything about someone you love but they will do something today that makes you realize there is a lot about them you still don’t understand. Is that such a bad thing? It keeps your relationship interesting. |02-17-2015|virgo
432|As the Sun moves into the relationship area of your chart today you will need to start working more closely with certain individuals. You may not like everyone you have to do business with but in the long-term it will be worth it.|02-18-2015|virgo
433|You may disagree with someone’s opinions today but you would still be wise to listen to what they have to say. It could be they know something that you do not, something that could make all the difference to your future.|02-19-2015|virgo
434|A financial opportunity of some kind is certainly worth pursuing but the planets warn it may not be quite as wonderful as you’ve been lead to believe. At the very least there will be a lot of work involved. Are you happy with that?|02-20-2015|virgo
435|Don’t pull your punches this weekend: tell others exactly what you think and, if certain people don’t like it, that’s just too bad. On the other hand, try not to be offensive for the sake of it. Why makes enemies when you don’t have to? |02-21-2015|virgo
436|If you are serious about getting things done over the coming week then you must make an effort to consult partners and colleagues first. If you need to ask for financial support wait until Mars links to Saturn on Thursday. |02-22-2015|virgo
437|With the Sun at right angles to Saturn you will have to give ground in some way. Compromise is not an option, it’s essential. There are times when you have no choice but to work as part of a team, and this is one of them.|02-23-2015|virgo
438|Don’t let anyone pressure you into making a hasty decision today, especially as it will be you who gets the blame if it all goes wrong. Know your own mind and don’t worry that you might upset important people. You’re important too.|02-24-2015|virgo
439|This is a good time for partnerships in general and affairs of the heart in particular, so forget about all the things that went wrong in the past and start thinking about all the wonderful things that will go right in the future. |02-25-2015|virgo
440|You seem to believe that the universe is against you but that simply is not true. Just because you have fallen out with a friend or loved one over something minor does not mean it’s the end of the world. It’s not even the end of the week!|02-26-2015|virgo
441|You will probably trust what you are told on the work front today, simply because the person doing the telling is someone you look up to. However, according to the planets they have got it wrong and you may not look up to them much longer.|02-27-2015|virgo
442|You seem a bit worried about your cash flow situation at the moment. In a way that’s good because it means you are less likely to make important decisions concerning your finances or business arrangements. Give it time and see how things develop.|02-28-2015|virgo
443|You won’t be much in the mood for socializing over the next few days but that’s okay because there are more serious things you should be focusing on. You may even have to bribe certain people to leave you alone. The cost will be worth it. |03-01-2015|virgo
444|Not even a Virgo knows all the answers (though you like to think you do) and what you discover today is sure to take you by surprise. It should also make you wonder how many other issues you know less about than you imagined. |03-02-2015|virgo
445|You more you try to break free of restrictions the more they seem to hold you back. Okay, so that may have been how it was in the past but it need not be that way now. Make an extra special effort to regain your independence.|03-03-2015|virgo
446|Don’t waste time getting other people’s opinions about what you intend to do. Just get on and do it and let the chips fall where they will. There will always be critics, of course, but you are under no obligation to listen to them.|03-04-2015|virgo
447|Stick with the facts today, even if the facts are not as thrilling as you would like them to be. The planets warn if you embellish the truth in any way, shape or form you will be found out and it will be embarrassing.|03-05-2015|virgo
448|With the Sun and Pluto linking across favorable areas of your chart today it may seem as if you cannot lose. But Pluto can be a deceptive influence, so it might be wise not to push your luck, especially when dealing with authority figures.|03-06-2015|virgo
449|You may not get a lot done work-wise this weekend but that’s okay. Even a Virgo needs to slow down, even slack off, once in a while and the less you do now the more successful the coming week is likely to be.|03-07-2015|virgo
450|A money matter needs to be dealt with urgently and the planets will help you make the kind of difficult decisions that you so often try to avoid. At some stage you will have to get tough with so-called partners who are no help at all.|03-08-2015|virgo
451|You have been playing a number of roles in recent weeks but you need to remember that they are make believe and not reality. The most likely reason you have been wearing a mask is to confuse people, but don’t let it confuse you too. |03-09-2015|virgo
452|You may be logical by nature but try not to be too rational in your thinking today because it will limit you to a smaller range of possibilities. If you want something enough you will find a way to get it, even if logic says it can’t be done.|03-10-2015|virgo
453|Others will respond to you extremely well today – it’s as if they are making a special effort to be nice to you. Take advantage of the situation by telling them what it is you need. They will go out of their way to get it for you.|03-11-2015|virgo
454|The time has come to admit that a partnership or relationship is not working out as well as you expected. It’s no big deal, and it is certainly not your fault. Some people you can do business with and some people you cannot. That’s life.|03-12-2015|virgo
455|What you say next is important but not as important as the way you choose to say it. You may intend your remarks to be helpful but if your words sound harsh others may get the impression that you are being critical for no good reason.|03-13-2015|virgo
456|As from this weekend a relationship that has been going through a tough time will start to get easier for both of you. There will still be a number of highly personal issues that need to be resolved but at least now you are working together.|03-14-2015|virgo
457|Strive to stay calm over the next few days. If you let your anger show it will only encourage those whose main joy in life seems to be trying to upset you. The best way to beat them is to not let their negativity get to you. |03-15-2015|virgo
458|Stay calm, be patient and don’t try to force the pace. You have to accept that, where your work is concerned, you have no choice but to wait while others catch up. However, where your love life is concerned, by all means race ahead. |03-16-2015|virgo
459|As from today you will find it easier to talk to work colleagues without some kind of fight breaking out. Thanks to Venus moving into one of the more positive areas of your chart you won’t be at each others’ throats all the time.|03-17-2015|virgo
460|With Mercury, your ruler, overshadowed by Neptune today you need to be careful when dealing with other people. You especially need to be careful if they flatter you because that means they are after something you won’t want to part with.|03-18-2015|virgo
461|An upheaval of some kind is likely over the next two or three days and there is precious little you can do about it. Actually, if you keep your wits about you and keep your emotions in check you could gain from someone else’s loss. |03-19-2015|virgo
462|Over the past few weeks the emphasis has been on partnerships of an emotional nature but as from today it will shift to partnerships of a business or financial nature. In short: treat other people’s money as carefully as your own. |03-20-2015|virgo
463|Sometimes you can have too many choices and that seems to be the problem at the moment. Be that as it may you know what you must do and you know you must do it immediately. It’s time to get tough, especially with yourself. |03-21-2015|virgo
464|Life is too short to worry about things that may never happen, so banish negative thoughts and act as if you cannot fail. A positive mental attitude will bring positive things your way over the coming week. Let others do the worrying. |03-22-2015|virgo
465|You may feel trapped by certain obligations but the fact is you made promises to people who believe in you and now you must keep them. If you don’t, your reputation could suffer damage it takes many months to repair.|03-23-2015|virgo
466|If you need to get away from your current environment now is the time to start making plans. You may not be able to get away immediately but what you decide today will make it easier for you to make your escape later on.|03-24-2015|virgo
467|Something will happen over the next 24 hours that gives you the opportunity to show how tough you can be. Flex your muscles, both physical and mental, and make sure those you deal with know you should never be taken for granted. |03-25-2015|virgo
468|If someone says you should not be concerned about what is going on in your social circle you will go out of your way to find out more – and what you discover will astound you. No wonder they tried to keep it a secret!|03-26-2015|virgo
469|If you admit you need help today you will be overwhelmed by offers of assistance. But don’t take the easy way out and let friends and colleagues do everything for you. The last thing you need is to become dependent on them.|03-27-2015|virgo
470|Something will happen this weekend that disrupts the way you look at the world and forces you to question your deepest beliefs. It may not be an easy experience but it will do you good. In future, try not to believe everything the “experts” tell you.|03-28-2015|virgo
471|Don’t waste time and energy arguing with others over trivial issues – there are more important things you could be thinking about. Put your health and wellbeing first now because soon you will have to make some much-needed lifestyle changes. |03-29-2015|virgo
472|Nothing truly happens by chance and if you keep that thought in mind today you will be able to make sense of something that leaves others baffled. Most people can’t see the connection between cause and effect – but you’re not most people. |03-30-2015|virgo
473|Don’t visit the same old places today: go somewhere different, ideally to a venue where there is a bit of life. With Mars moving into the most adventurous area of your chart you will be at your best when on the move. |03-31-2015|virgo
474|The planets are very much on your side at the moment. Mars, especially, is urging you to take a few risks and show the world what you are capable of. The powers that be will respect you more if you fight for what you believe in.|04-01-2015|virgo
475|Don’t wait for others to make decisions for you: make them yourself and, if anyone disapproves, so what? Anyone who thinks you can be intimidated and told what to do is in for the shock of their lives over the next few days.|04-02-2015|virgo
476|Worry less about how you get along with people in positions of power and more about how you get along with people who are important to you on a personal level. Family relationships must always come ahead of your career.|04-03-2015|virgo
477|If you must take risks with money this weekend make sure you have a get-out clause. Today’s lunar eclipse warns you are likely to come off second best in deals involving cash. You have enough debts already – don’t make things worse.|04-04-2015|virgo
478|Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart means you won’t be so outgoing and expressive over the next few days. If you need to be by yourself for a while then do it and don’t feel guilty about it. |04-05-2015|virgo
479|Look in the mirror and be honest about what you see. If you can do that today then you will put yourself at an advantage when dealing with people who are not so honest about their own faults and failings – which is just about everyone! |04-06-2015|virgo
480|If someone annoys you today you will react in a way that surprises a few people – and scares a few more! Yes, of course, you will regret it tomorrow when you have calmed down but sometimes it’s good to get angry.|04-07-2015|virgo
481|This could be a confusing day in that something is so obviously going right for you now but you still feel it could fall apart at any moment. Stop worrying about what the future may bring and start living in the moment.|04-08-2015|virgo
482|If you get the urge to try something different over the next 24 hours then by all means follow your instincts. Leo may be a “fixed” sign but you’re not as set in your ways as some people think – in fact you can be quite adventurous.|04-09-2015|virgo
483|You need to make your peace with someone you have fallen out with in recent weeks. The planets suggest that if you make the effort you won’t be disappointed. Be nice to others now and you will benefit in unexpected ways later on.|04-10-2015|virgo
484|If you want to move up in the world you must make more of an effort to impress employers and other important people. But don’t make your effort too much of an effort: they will be more impressed if you make it look easy.|04-11-2015|virgo
485|Other people cannot give you success and security – these are things that only you can bring into your life. What happens today will give you the chance to question if you are on the right track. If you’re not, then start making changes. |04-13-2015|virgo
486|You will enjoy yourself more if you are on the move. It may still be early in the week but if you can arrange a trip to some place you have never been to before you should do so as it will open your mind to new possibilities.|04-14-2015|virgo
487|Career matters are under favorable stars at the moment, so be positive and positive things will occur. Attitude is everything: if colleagues and employers sense that you are serious about your aims then they will be serious about them as well.|04-15-2015|virgo
488|Life may not be a bundle of fun at the moment but don’t worry about it. The Sun moves in your favor in a few days time and once it does the smile will return to your face. It’s all good – or it will be very soon. |04-17-2015|virgo
489|Try not to attach too much importance to material things. Yes, you could lose something over the next 48 hours but in the greater scheme of things it is of no real importance. You may even be better off without it.|04-18-2015|virgo
490|So many new opportunities will come your way when the Sun moves into your fellow Earth sign of Taurus tomorrow. Make each and every one of them count. Sheer force of personality will get you where you want to go. |04-19-2015|virgo
491|One way or another you will get what you want over the next 24 hours. However, you will get it quicker and easier if you avoid strong arm tactics and use charm and persuasion to win rivals over. Make friends, not enemies.|04-20-2015|virgo
492|You must question everything you hear today, because the planets warn that some of the things you will be told are designed to mislead you rather than inform you. You don’t need others’ opinions – you can see what’s going on for yourself.|04-21-2015|virgo
493|You can expect something wonderful to happen today. Most likely news from afar will inspire you to believe that the good days are back at last and it won’t be long before there is even more evidence of that. Start planning your next vacation.|04-22-2015|virgo
494|If your intuition tells you to follow a certain course of action then do so even if everyone else thinks you are mad. When that little voice inside your head starts talking you really must listen – and close your ears to everything else.|04-23-2015|virgo
495|It may be easy to change things but before you start moving this here and that there ask yourself if it is necessary. Chances are you will be changing not because you want to but because you think it is expected of you. It isn’t, so don’t.|04-24-2015|virgo
496|You may have gone to extremes of late but now you realize that compromise is necessary. The planets urge you to seek help from those you love and trust, because their input could be the difference between failure and success. |04-25-2015|virgo
497|You seem incredibly decisive now and during the early part of the week you will be making calls left, right and center. They won’t always be correct but your self-belief is such that few, if any, will dare point out your mistakes.|04-26-2015|virgo
498|Your sixth sense is telling you that something is wrong with your life and needs to be fixed. So what are you waiting for? There will be a lot of upheavals over the next few days – use them to disguise your own mini revolution.|04-27-2015|virgo
499|Nothing is beyond you now and if you put your mind to it you can reach new heights over the next week or so. This is also a good time to go back and try again at something you failed at earlier in the year.|04-28-2015|virgo
500|Is it really possible that so many good things are happening and that so much is going your way at the moment? Yes, of course it is, and they will continue to go your way so long as you believe that you deserve it.|04-29-2015|virgo
501|Career matters will take a turn for the better over the next few days but to make the most of events you will need a positive attitude. Get rid of those feelings of inferiority and get ready to show the world what you can do.|04-30-2015|virgo
502|If you are not making career plans then you should be. Don’t think only in terms of earning money and moving up the corporate ladder, think too about making a difference. Find ways to help those who are less fortunate than you. |05-01-2015|virgo
503|Someone you work or socialize with requires your assistance and you must do what you can to help them. You may not owe them anything as such but your kind heart won’t let you ignore their suffering. You’re nice like that. |05-02-2015|virgo
504|Your best course of action now is to ignore what your rivals and enemies are saying and do what you know deep down to be right. Actually that’s the best course of action at any time but it is doubly important that you don’t hesitate now|05-03-2015|virgo
505|The worst possible thing you can do now is to try to conform to the kind of image you think others have of you. You are who you are for a reason, so forget about what friends and family members expect of you and just be yourself. |05-04-2015|virgo
506|Don’t overdo it physically today. It may be true that no effort is too much for you while the Sun moves through your fellow Earth sign of Taurus but you have limits like everyone else and if you go too far you could regret it.|05-05-2015|virgo
507|You have your doubts about a plan or project that everyone else seems enthusiastic about and if you are smart you will speak up and start a debate. It could well be the case that your sharp mind has seen a flaw that others have missed. |05-06-2015|virgo
508|The order of the day according to the cosmos is to have as much fun as is humanly possible. You have been working far too hard of late. You have been far too stressed. If you’re not smiling then you are doing it wrong.|05-07-2015|virgo
509|Chances are you will be forced to stay where you are today, even though you would much rather be on the move. That might sound like bad news but the planets indicate it could be a blessing in disguise. Stay home and keep a low profile. |05-08-2015|virgo
510|You will be tempted to go to extremes this weekend but the planets warn you will regret it if you do. Tread carefully when dealing with anyone who has a claim on your loyalty – it could be a claim you don’t want them to have.|05-09-2015|virgo
511|Life is too short to worry about what others might think, so do what makes you feel good and, if certain people throw up their hands in horror, take it as a sign that you are on the right track. The last thing you want is their support. |05-10-2015|virgo
512|There is something you want to do but your instincts tell you it won’t go down well with certain people. That’s settled then: you are going to do it! You are in one of those moods when you enjoy causing a bit of chaos. |05-11-2015|virgo
513|If you approach someone in a position of authority over the next 24 hours you are sure to get a positive response. They may not give you everything you ask for but they will give you what you need most – exceedingly good advice.|05-12-2015|virgo
514|Play it cool today and don’t worry that others may be doing better or getting paid more than you. It is always a mistake to compare yourself to colleagues and rivals and it would be even more of a mistake today. Your time will come.|05-13-2015|virgo
515|Do not say anything you suspect may not be true. The words may not have come from you originally – you are merely passing them along – but the planets warn it is you who will take the blame. Never trade in gossip or hearsay.|05-14-2015|virgo
516|You have to tell someone you like something that you know is going to hurt their feelings. Get it over with quickly. Say what you have to say and don’t pause for breath. One day they will thank you for being so honest.|05-15-2015|virgo
517|Minor doubts could stop you taking advantage of some kind of offer or opening this weekend and that would be a shame. According to the planets you have nothing to fear, so stop worrying and start taking a few risks.|05-16-2015|virgo
518|Because the approaching new moon takes place in the sympathetic sign of Taurus you can go where you want to go and do what you want to do over the next two or three days. So, what are you waiting for? Map out a route. |05-17-2015|virgo
519|You will be remarkably outspoken today and anyone who does not want to hear the truth had better put their hands over their ears. You don’t care about hurting the feelings of certain people – in fact they are the ones who need shaking up. |05-18-2015|virgo
520|The plans you make over the next few days may have to be revised in the light of new information come next weekend, so don’t make them too binding. Remember: there is a world of difference between creative thinking and wishful thinking.|05-19-2015|virgo
521|As the Sun crosses the career angle of your chart tomorrow the next two or three days are going to be extremely important for your ambitions. If ever there was a time to sets your sights higher that time is now. Be the best.|05-20-2015|virgo
522|Try not to think of everything that happens in terms of win or lose. With the Sun crossing the career angle of your chart today you are sure to be more competitive than usual but you don’t have to take it to extremes.|05-21-2015|virgo
523|You must not allow your personal feelings to interfere with what needs to be done on the work front today. Some things are business and some things are personal and if you don’t know the difference it’s about time you learned. |05-22-2015|virgo
524|Don’t worry if you have serious things to deal with, just push them to one side for the time being and come back to them later. Make it your business to have fun this weekend. Yes, you may pay for it later but worry about it then.|05-23-2015|virgo
525|Don’t be rushed into making an important decision about your career because you cannot possibly know all the facts. What facts you do have may point in a certain direction but can you be sure you are not being misled? No you cannot.|05-24-2015|virgo
526|You may feel sorry for people who have lost their way but you are not responsible for their troubles. There are though some things that you can influence directly. Identify what they are and do what you can, but don’t expect miracles.|05-25-2015|virgo
527|You may be eager to try new things but don’t take unnecessary risks with either your money or your reputation. While your ruling planet Mercury continues to move retrograde you should aim to play safe, in some things at least. |05-26-2015|virgo
