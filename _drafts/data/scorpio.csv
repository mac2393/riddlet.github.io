0|The upcoming new moon in the money area of your chart will bring out your extravagant side (yes, you do have one) and if you are not careful your taste for the high life could leave you broke. Make sure others pay their share.|12-01-2013|scorpio
1|You may have to hurt someone’s feelings today by saying something you know they don’t want to hear but if you don’t they will keep making the same mistake over and over again. As a friend, you have a duty to speak up.|12-02-2013|scorpio
2|The more you are told you can’t have something the more you will make a point of getting it – which could be fun but could also lead to situations that do you no favors. Don’t let your desires get out of hand and become obsessions.|12-03-2013|scorpio
3|You may have deep personal feelings about a certain situation but you must not let emotions get in the way of what needs to be done. Yes, of course, love makes the world go around but it needs a large dash of common sense too.|12-04-2013|scorpio
4|You will, as usual, get your way today and you will, as usual, win whatever battle of words and wits you are involved in. Bear this thought in mind though: just because you win does not mean you are right. Which is more important? |12-05-2013|scorpio
5|Everything is going according to plan and even though you may not get all the things you desire today you will certainly get all the things you need. The cosmos, as always, is looking over and looking after you, so why worry?|12-06-2013|scorpio
6|Lack of confidence is rarely your problem but this could be one of those days when you are reluctant to take a risk or get involved in issues that could be divisive. Maybe that’s good. Maybe you should be acting less and thinking more.|12-07-2013|scorpio
7|Fate may at times seem to be having fun at your expense but that is just the way it looks in the short-term. Try not to think of what happens in terms of days and weeks but in months and years. Your future looks exceedingly bright. |12-08-2013|scorpio
8|No matter how honest you think someone may be you would be wise not to let them make decisions for you today, especially if those decisions involve your hard-earned cash. If there are any risks to be taken you must take them yourself.|12-09-2013|scorpio
9|Seize the initiative. Start something new. Yes, of course, you have failed to follow through so many times in the past but this time can and will be different. What happened to all those big ideas you had? They’re still there for you to use.|12-10-2013|scorpio
10|You may not be able to rely on certain people as much as you have done in recent weeks but the truth is you no longer need them. There is a major luck factor working in your life at the moment. Take full advantage of it.|12-11-2013|scorpio
11|When you get annoyed you tend to go to extremes and some unfortunate person is going to be in your bad books today. Yes, maybe you will be too hard on them, but it will be a long time before they dare to upset you again.|12-12-2013|scorpio
12|You could be a bit too secretive for your own good today. According to the planets you will do better, both financially and emotionally, if you open up and let friends and family members know how you feel and what it is you need.|12-13-2013|scorpio
13|You seem to be going through one of those phases when you turn your attention in on yourself. There’s nothing wrong with that but don’t forget you have duties in the wider world too. Too much inner analysis could be costly (and boring).|12-14-2013|scorpio
14|Try not to rely so much on your hunches over the next seven days. Yes, of course, your inner voice can usually be trusted but it would still be wise to check facts and figures for yourself before laying your money on the table.|12-15-2013|scorpio
15|You will be rather outspoken today, which is not that unusual, but make sure your criticisms are justified or you could make enemies of people who should be your friends. If you damage someone’s reputation they’ll want to damage you.|12-16-2013|scorpio
16|Someone will give you a hard time today and as you are not the sort to back down it could lead to a bad situation. However, if you find yourself battling someone in a position of power don’t take it too far. You’ll lose in the long-term.|12-17-2013|scorpio
17|You won’t get things all your own way today, especially on the home front where partners and loved ones are anything but reasonable. The good news is this is only a passing phase, so let it pass and don’t be tempted to blow your top.|12-18-2013|scorpio
18|Slow things right down and take stock of how far you have come, because only then will you be in a position to decide how far you still have to go. Despite what some might say you’ve done well and deserve a pat on the back. |12-19-2013|scorpio
19|Be careful what you say because you could easily go over the top and let slip something that causes trouble. It might also cost you financially if others get the impression that you can’t hold your tongue in sensitive situations.|12-20-2013|scorpio
20|You are dwelling too much on the past when you should be thinking ahead. The good news is your attitude will take a turn for the better today. The even better news is the attitude of others towards you will be positive in every way.|12-21-2013|scorpio
21|You won’t worry much about money over the next few days, mainly because there are so many things going on in your life that you don’t have time to stop and count your cash. Good. The less you think about it the happier you will be.|12-22-2013|scorpio
22|There is a danger that you could let your emotions get the better of you, just when you need to think with your head rather than feel with your heart. Personal factors must be kept out of things today. It’s all about common sense.|12-23-2013|scorpio
23|You will get the chance to move up in the world in some way over the next few days and even though your mind may be on other things you must grab the opportunity. Don’t worry about taking on more responsibility – you’ll handle it.|12-24-2013|scorpio
24|You may find it hard to express yourself in the way you want to today but it’s no big deal. Those who know you well also know how you feel about them, so there’s no need to worry. Besides, actions always speak louder than words.|12-25-2013|scorpio
25|Something important is about to happen in your life and chances are it is something you will enjoy very much. Most likely it will have something to do with your social life, so don’t sit at home brooding – get out into the world.|12-26-2013|scorpio
26|Some people can be amazingly stupid but you won’t make them any smarter by making a big deal out of their mistakes. They are who they are and that isn’t going to change, so as far as possible just keep out of their way.|12-27-2013|scorpio
27|In the greater scheme of things there is no such thing as luck: ultimately we all get what we deserve. Bear that thought in mind if someone tells you that your good fortune has not been earned. On the contrary, no one deserves it more.|12-28-2013|scorpio
28|Do what comes naturally and don’t worry in the slightest what other people might think about it. The more open you are about your needs and desires and the more confident you look, speak and act the more respect you will get from the world.|12-29-2013|scorpio
29|You may experience a loss of confidence today but there is nothing to fear or get worked up about. On the contrary, with so many positive influences working for you now even your “down” times will look “up” to most other people.|12-30-2013|scorpio
30|A little cooperation will go a long way over the next 24 hours, so be ready to put your differences with certain people behind you and look for ways you can work together for your mutual benefit. You don’t have to be at odds all the time. |12-31-2013|scorpio
31|This should be a thoroughly enjoyable day and even if you have serious things to do you will still have a great deal of fun. Someone you meet while socializing or traveling will become more than just a friend, and that’s a nice thought.|01-01-2014|scorpio
32|There is no point feeling sorry for yourself, not even if your number one plan seems to have hit a brick wall. If fate in its wisdom wants you to stop for a while or maybe even try a different course just take it in your stride.|01-02-2014|scorpio
33|News you have been waiting for will arrive today and put an end to a worrying phase. Whether the news is “good” or “bad” is unimportant — what matters is that at last you know where you stand. Now you can start moving forward again.|01-03-2014|scorpio
34|Try not to let others know what you are thinking today, because most likely you are not thinking straight and what you say will cause misunderstandings. Keep your lips sealed. For a secretive Scorpio that should not be too difficult.|01-04-2014|scorpio
35|You still seem to be brooding on things that are over and done with. You may have good reason to feel hard done by but you cannot go back and change the past – you can only go forward and make sure the future is different.|01-05-2014|scorpio
36|The choices you make over the next few days will have a major impact on the direction your life takes over the next few months, so make them wisely. You don’t have to be cautious but you do have to be aware of all the options.|01-06-2014|scorpio
37|Stop worrying that you are not doing enough or that your rivals are winning. The planets indicate that success will be yours once you learn to relax and not take life so seriously. Strangely, that’s when the serious rewards start to arrive. |01-07-2014|scorpio
38|It seems you have made an error of judgment and all you can do is say sorry. If you sound sincere about it others will forgive you and you can move on together. If, however, your apology is grudging bad feelings are likely to linger.|01-08-2014|scorpio
39|Let others know what you are willing to put up with and what will happen if they push their luck too far. There is a time to be tactful but this isn’t one of them – be bold and, if you think it is necessary, be a touch brutal too.|01-09-2014|scorpio
40|Interesting information will come your way over the next 24 hours, the kind of information that makes it easier for you to get your way. Once others realize you are ahead of the game they are much more likely to do as you say.|01-10-2014|scorpio
41|A minor difference of opinion could get out of hand and lead to a major upheaval today. Yes, of course, others can be both unreasonable and touchy at times, but you don’t have to fan the flames. It does not have to be a war of words.|01-11-2014|scorpio
42|Make sure the figures you are responsible for add up, because if there are any discrepancies your rivals will point the finger and suggest it’s all your fault. Take extra care financially – make sure every last cent is accounted for.|01-12-2014|scorpio
43|You seem to be more open towards strangers than usual and that’s good because someone you meet over the next few days could become not just a friend but also a business partner. You can have fun and make money together too.|01-13-2014|scorpio
44|You will push yourself hard over the next few days, of that there is little doubt, but will you push yourself in the right direction? That remains to be seen. Just make sure you don’t push past someone in a position of power – they won’t like it.|01-14-2014|scorpio
45|The tensions in one particular area of your life have almost reached breaking point but that need not be as bad as it sounds. In fact it could even be good if it clears away all those resentments you’ve been saving up these past few months.|01-15-2014|scorpio
46|Don’t get upset if others don’t seem interested in what you have to tell them. It’s unlikely you will get much sense out of them over the next 24 hours. If you want intelligent conversation, you may have to talk to yourself.|01-16-2014|scorpio
47|Try not to make decisions for friends and loved ones because no matter how well intentioned you may be they are sure to resent it. Let them learn from their own mistakes and be there to help them up off the floor if they need it.|01-17-2014|scorpio
48|Family matters of one sort or another seem to be taking up an increasingly large part of your time and energy. That is only to be expected but it does not mean you have to let other people’s needs eclipse your own. You have desires too.|01-18-2014|scorpio
49|The problems that confront you now are problems you have faced many times before, so you should know how to deal with them. But if you are still not sure what your next move should be don’t be afraid to ask a friend for advice.|01-19-2014|scorpio
50|Try to be more sensitive when dealing with emotional issues that involve other people. The thing to remember is that not everyone is as robust as you – in fact some people are quite fragile. So, if they burst into tears, you’re doing it wrong!|01-20-2014|scorpio
51|The decisions you make over the next few days will have a lasting impact on your domestic situation, so make sure you know all the facts and make sure you are not being misled by those who have an axe to grind or an agenda to fulfill.|01-21-2014|scorpio
52|You may be reserved by nature but every now and again you go right the other way and say things that shock those around you – and this is one of those days. Put simply, you’ve had enough of complaints and criticisms. It’s time to hit back.|01-22-2014|scorpio
53|Rarely have you had so many obligations. Rarely have your duties been so arduous. That’s the bad news. The good news is there are people in your life who will happily lend a hand – all you have to do is ask. Or is that too much for your ego?|01-23-2014|scorpio
54|There is a reason for everything that happens in life – ultimately there is no such thing as luck. Keep that thought in mind today and it will help you keep your feet on the ground regardless of whether events are classed as “good” or “bad”.|01-24-2014|scorpio
55|It will pay you to adopt a low profile this weekend, not least because a certain individual is looking for an excuse to pick holes in what you say and do. Don’t make it easy for them: do one of your famous disappearing acts.|01-25-2014|scorpio
56|Some kind of feud or falling-out is getting you down but the good news is that if you make the first move and let others know that you want to be friends again they will jump at the chance to make a new start. Go for it.|01-26-2014|scorpio
57|Don’t do something just because it is forbidden today – it may be fun breaking the rules but it could also be costly. Risks are allowed, of course, but they must be of the calculated variety. Anything else is asking for trouble.|01-27-2014|scorpio
58|Anything of a creative nature will go well, but it will go even better if you make an effort to involve loved ones in what you are doing. Sometimes you get so intensely involved in your work that others feel left out. Let them help you.|01-28-2014|scorpio
59|If your daily routine is making too many demands on you, then maybe it’s time you did something about it. However, because the changes you make this week are likely to become permanent changes, make sure you really want them.|01-29-2014|scorpio
60|No matter how badly someone may have let you down you must forgive them. There is no point holding a grudge, not when there are so many wonderful things going on in the world. If you’re not smiling then you’re doing it wrong.|01-30-2014|scorpio
61|Have fun. Enjoy yourself. Hang out with your friends. This isn’t a day to think about work or money or any of the many other things you have been worrying about. You deserve a break so reward yourself. Others will be happy for you too.|01-31-2014|scorpio
62|Your money worries should begin to ease this weekend but you must not lose sight of the fact that the underlying cause of your financial anxiety remains. In the long-term you must either cut back on your spending or earn a lot more.|02-01-2014|scorpio
63|Take care that in your hurry to impress important people you don’t overestimate your abilities and take on too much. You may not like to say “no” to those whose support you are trying to secure but they won’t be impressed if you fail to deliver.|02-03-2014|scorpio
64|You need to ask the right questions today and to ask the right questions you need to see your life for what it is, not what you wish it might be. Your main task for the next 24 hours, and after, is to be completely honest with yourself.|02-04-2014|scorpio
65|If you can imagine it, you can do it — yes, it really is as simple as that. You know what it is you desire and you know what needs to be done to get it, so stop playing around and get serious about your ambitions. Time is running out. |02-05-2014|scorpio
66|You may have to be abrupt, even rude, with certain people today, simply because they are too slow and too stupid to work things out for themselves. Don’t bruise egos for the fun of it but make sure what needs to get done gets done, and quickly.|02-06-2014|scorpio
67|If you must get involved in a dispute between friends make sure you are scrupulously even-handed. If you give the impression that you favor one side more than the other you will make things worse than if you had left well alone.|02-07-2014|scorpio
68|There is a real chance that one or more of your dreams is about to come true, so keep telling yourself that all things are possible and keep believing that success is just around the next corner. Today’s dream is tomorrow’s reality.|02-08-2014|scorpio
69|Don’t worry too much if you feel a bit gloomy today because you will brighten up considerably later in the week. If you don’t feel like working or socializing then don’t force yourself. Sit quietly, think deeply and meditate on the meaning of life.|02-10-2014|scorpio
70|Not everyone is as dynamic as you, and you would be wise to bear that thought in mind today, especially when dealing with people who seem indecisive. You may think they are dragging their feet on purpose but it’s just the way they are. |02-11-2014|scorpio
71|All things are possible for those born under the sign of the Scorpion but that does not mean success will happen as if by magic – you still need to be clear about what it is you want and committed to getting it. Reaffirm your desires today.|02-12-2014|scorpio
72|There is still time, just, to make your feelings known but if you leave it too late in the day the opportunity will slip past and it won’t come again for quite a while. Don’t worry that you might be rejected. Others think highly of you.|02-13-2014|scorpio
73|It seems you are having second thoughts about a career move. You want to move up in the world, of course, but is this the route you should be taking? Think about it but don’t make any decisions yet. Everything will be clearer next week.|02-14-2014|scorpio
74|People expect you to be cautious, so why not surprise them this weekend and do something out of the ordinary? It may be a long time before you feel this open and outgoing again, so make the most of it and make sure you get noticed.|02-15-2014|scorpio
75|The good times may have been avoiding you of late but in a matter of days, maybe hours, your luck will improve a hundredfold. The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow marks the start of the most dynamic and creative time of the year.|02-17-2014|scorpio
76|The Sun spends the next few weeks transiting the most dynamic and creative area of your chart, so set your sights high and don’t think for a moment that you can’t reach the top. A positive attitude will yield positive results in all your affairs.|02-18-2014|scorpio
77|Avoid quick fixes and dubious schemes today because, inevitably, they will cost you money. Anyone who approaches you with any of those once-in-a-lifetime, just-can’t-lose proposals must be shown the door. Make sure you bolt it after them. |02-19-2014|scorpio
78|Be forceful today. Put your own interests first. The Sun in Pisces is giving you a massive boost of confidence, so make the most of it and make sure everyone knows where you are coming from and what you intend to do. Then do it.|02-20-2014|scorpio
79|You need to confront a fear that has been holding you back and you need to do it now. A little bit of courage will take you a long way, maybe all the way to a new life and a new way of looking at and thinking about the world.|02-21-2014|scorpio
80|Avoid all kinds of wishful thinking over the next 48 hours. Only by taking a realistic attitude to your current situation, both professional and financial, will you come to a correct conclusion as to what needs to be done. Honesty with yourself is essential.|02-22-2014|scorpio
81|Anything of a creative, artistic or romantic nature will go well this week. Even if you are one of those Scorpios who doesn’t like to court attention you will be assertive and ambitious over the next seven days. You can succeed and you will succeed.|02-23-2014|scorpio
82|The Sun in Pisces makes this one of the best times of the year for you and when the Sun links with Jupiter next weekend you will get your reward for the efforts you have made. Between now and then though be patient. Good things will come.|02-24-2014|scorpio
83|It’s time to put your own interests first and start work on something you have been thinking about for weeks, months, maybe even years. This is an excellent day for creative activities, so put your doubts behind you and follow your dream.|02-25-2014|scorpio
84|There is a danger that what you say over the next 24 hours will be taken the wrong way and used against you at some stage in the future. Misunderstandings can be costly, so spell out what you mean in plain language. Leave nothing to chance.|02-26-2014|scorpio
85|Keep your eye on the ball and keep your mind on what it is you are hoping to accomplish. If you can do that then you will succeed. The approaching new moon will give you added drive and dynamism. How can you lose? You can’t!|02-27-2014|scorpio
86|It may annoy you that someone is saying things that are blatantly untrue but don’t let your anger show. The best approach is to pretend that you have not noticed and that you agree with every word they say. Then prove them wrong.|02-28-2014|scorpio
87|Life is good and about to get even better. Both the new moon and a wonderful Sun-Jupiter link mean that Lady Luck is about to smile on you in a big way. There is no doubt at all you will get what you want – and soon!|03-01-2014|scorpio
88|You have been far too negative and far too critical of your efforts of late. The good news is that when Jupiter moves in your favor again on Thursday your mood will improve dramatically. The meaning of life is to have fun, nothing more.|03-02-2014|scorpio
89|How much confidence do you have in your abilities? Hopefully it’s a lot because with the Sun linked to your ruler Pluto there are going to be some big changes over the next few days – changes that affect you on a personal level.|03-03-2014|scorpio
90|Try to avoid petty arguments, especially the sort that drag on for days. Yes, it may look to others as if you are taking the easy way out but the fact is you cannot be bothered to waste time on issues that don’t mean a thing to you.|03-04-2014|scorpio
91|Venus, the planet that helps smooth over difficulties, moves into the domestic area of your chart today. If you are smart you will use its influence to reorder your home life in ways that suit your needs while not annoying or obstructing others.|03-05-2014|scorpio
92|Don’t give in too easily today, especially on the work front where colleagues and employers will take advantage of you if you don’t stand up for yourself. You may want to do things for them but you really should not be doing everything.|03-06-2014|scorpio
93|Someone you meet over the next two or three days will inspire you creatively and maybe romantically too. Will this new liaison stand the test of time? There is no way of knowing for sure but it will certainly be fun finding out!|03-07-2014|scorpio
94|You may think you have been short-changed in some way but that isn’t true. If you make the most of what you have it won’t be long before you realize just how fortunate you have been. You haven’t been short-changed at all – you’ve been blessed.|03-08-2014|scorpio
95|The Sun in Pisces makes you active in the extreme but other influences suggest you would benefit from taking life at a slower pace for a while. Instead of trying to make things happen try instead to understand what is already taking place.|03-09-2014|scorpio
96|You won’t have to work too hard to get what you want this week. With both the Sun and Jupiter on your side others will happily provide you with whatever it is that is good for you. Hopefully it will be good for them too.|03-10-2014|scorpio
97|The message of the stars for you today is that you must not start worrying for no good reason. The challenges that come your way over the next few days will be tough but you are ten times tougher. You’re better looking than your rivals too!|03-11-2014|scorpio
98|If you do anything to excess between now and the full moon on the 16th you will most likely regret it, so tone down your act and don’t try so hard to impress friends and colleagues. You’re a star already, so shouldn’t they be trying to impress you?|03-12-2014|scorpio
99|Saturn in your sign, linked to the Sun in Pisces, urges you to take life at a slower pace. What you achieve, over the next 24 hours or the next 24 years, will not be determined by speed but by staying power. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.|03-13-2014|scorpio
100|This is a good day to take care of the little, everyday things that need doing, both at home and at work. Don’t set yourself any grand targets, just get the small stuff done and leave the grand design to sort itself out. It always does.|03-14-2014|scorpio
101|Tomorrow’s full moon warns you need to be careful when talking about your plans. The more information you give away the more likely it is that rivals will steal your ideas. What happened to that secretive Scorpio we all know and love?|03-15-2014|scorpio
102|Not everyone will agree with the route you have chosen to take but that is irrelevant. Listen to what friends and family have to tell you this week but don’t think for a moment that you have to follow their advice. You know best.|03-16-2014|scorpio
103|You may be fixed in your opinions but you are not the only one with strong beliefs. Disagreements of one sort or another are likely this week but that’s okay. New ideas may create tension but tension itself can be creative.|03-17-2014|scorpio
104|According to the planets you are thinking too much about the past and not nearly enough about the future. Your task today is to switch your attention away from what was and toward what could be – and your options really are unlimited.|03-18-2014|scorpio
105|You need to start thinking seriously about cutting back on the amount of work you are doing. The past few weeks have been a time of great activity and your momentum will keep you going for a while yet, but your body needs a break.|03-19-2014|scorpio
106|It is one thing to be a hard worker but quite another to waste your time and energy on tasks that mean nothing to you personally. Your one and only aim today must be to decide what is important to you and what should be junked.|03-20-2014|scorpio
107|Today’s lunar eclipse of Saturn in your sign suggests you are bursting to say things you know you should not. However, the longer you keep your thoughts and feelings bottled up inside the bigger the eventual explosion will be – so speak up.|03-21-2014|scorpio
108|Others will slap you on the back and tell you what a wonderful job you are doing and, of course, they are right. But don’t let the praise go to your head because most likely they are only being nice because they want something from you.|03-23-2014|scorpio
109|Don’t be afraid to take a few risks on the work front this week. The planets indicate you need to be more adventurous where your methods and routines are concerned. Just be careful you don’t overdo it and damage your health.|03-24-2014|scorpio
110|It would appear that you are in possession of information that could be dangerous to the kind of people who would do almost anything to make sure it stays private. Unless you enjoy making enemies maybe you should keep it to yourself.|03-25-2014|scorpio
111|You must carry on with a creative or artistic endeavor that you may have been thinking of giving up on completely. You don’t seem to realize how close you are to a breakthrough. If you give up now you may never forgive yourself.|03-26-2014|scorpio
112|You will find it easy to work out what is going on in someone’s mind today, which in turn will help you decide what you should do next. You have a knack for seeing the kind of body language that other people miss. Make it work for you.|03-27-2014|scorpio
113|Reach out to someone you have not seen or heard from in a while. Arrange a get-together in the very near future. Not only will you have plenty of gossip to catch up on – you may find your long-term plans coincide quite nicely too.|03-28-2014|scorpio
114|If you need a break you must take one, no matter how much others might try to persuade you to work even harder. Even Scorpios need to relax and recharge their batteries every now and again, so be kind to yourself.|03-29-2014|scorpio
115|If you owe someone a debt you must pay it off over the next few days. As a Scorpio you should know that it simply isn’t possible to wriggle out of these things – what goes around always comes around eventually, so pay it and move on. |03-30-2014|scorpio
116|If you take a negative view of what is going on you may get stuck in one of those woe-is-me moods that are so hard to shift. Make a conscious mental and emotional effort to look on the bright side today – it’s always there.|03-31-2014|scorpio
117|Some of what you hear over the next 24 hours may be less than complimentary but in the greater scheme of things it is of no real importance, so don’t let it upset your equilibrium. What happened to that famous Scorpio spirit?|04-01-2014|scorpio
118|You may now be having second thoughts about something you recently agreed to but the fact is it’s too late to change things. Even if you were able to do so it would cost you too much in terms of time, money and damaged reputation.|04-02-2014|scorpio
119|A relationship that has gone through some difficult times can be repaired but first you must ask yourself if that is what you truly desire. The Sun at odds with your ruler Pluto suggests you may be thinking of ending it once and for all.|04-03-2014|scorpio
120|You are doing too many things for too many people and need to slow down a bit. If you carry on trying to do it all you are sure to burn yourself out, physically and emotionally, so stop catering to their every whim and fancy.|04-04-2014|scorpio
121|Someone you thought you could trust has been misleading you, or at the very least keeping things from you that you ought to know about. But what was their motivation? Maybe they thought they were doing it for your own good.|04-05-2014|scorpio
122|You may be desperate to show what you can do but don’t go over the top and do something silly. Why? Because it makes you an easy target for those who would like nothing better than to derail your ambitions. Think smart and act smart too.|04-06-2014|scorpio
123|You need to recharge your physical, mental and emotional batteries, so don’t make too many plans for the next few days. In fact, if you can find ways to pamper yourself or, even better, get loved ones to pamper you, go for it.|04-07-2014|scorpio
124|Try not to take what you see and hear personally today, not even if others make it clear it is meant to be personal. Yes, you know how to be vengeful, but sometimes it’s better to let annoying issues sail over your head.|04-08-2014|scorpio
125|Focus on what seems right to you and ignore what the so-called “experts” tell you if it does not fit in with your way of thinking. Ultimately there are no such things as facts, there are only various shades of opinion, and yours deserve to be heard.|04-09-2014|scorpio
126|For some strange reason you are wracked by self-doubt. For some strange reason you seem to believe you do not have the talent to be a success. That simply isn’t true. Get your head straight and get on with making your mark on the world.|04-10-2014|scorpio
127|You may not understand why so many people are singing your praises at the moment but you must have done something to warrant being the center of attention. Don’t waste time thinking about it – milk the applause for all it’s worth.|04-11-2014|scorpio
128|Try not to let your anxieties get the better of you. What looks like such a huge problem now will be swept away by what happens around the time of the lunar eclipse on the 15th. It’s all about perspective, so widen your horizons.|04-12-2014|scorpio
129|Stick to the script and don’t be tempted to go off at a tangent. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your working environment where others will not take kindly to you disrupting routines without clearing it with them first.|04-13-2014|scorpio
130|This is not a good time to make hasty decisions, not with Pluto, your ruler, beginning one of its retrograde phases. What seems like a good idea today may turn out later to be the one thing you should have avoided, so take care.|04-14-2014|scorpio
131|Whatever happens today, be it good, bad or indifferent, you must treat it as if it is of no real importance in the greater scheme of things. Remember too that if you allow feelings to guide you then your fears will most likely take over.|04-15-2014|scorpio
132|No matter how eager you may be to begin something you have every reason to believe will bring you fame and fortune it might be best to wait a bit. The Sun’s change of signs at the weekend could lead to a change in your priorities.|04-16-2014|scorpio
133|There is a battle of wills going on at the moment, either in your career or your social circle, and it’s a battle you cannot afford to lose. Your sign has a reputation for ruthlessness and it’s something you should be looking to live up to.|04-17-2014|scorpio
134|You will make sacrifices above and beyond the call of duty over the next 24 hours and everyone will be singing your praises. Virtue may be its own reward but that does not mean you can’t treat yourself too. What do you fancy?|04-18-2014|scorpio
135|You are now about halfway through your solar year – the midpoint between one birthday and the next – and that makes this the ideal time to take stock of how far you have come. Then you’ll have a good idea how far there is still to go.|04-19-2014|scorpio
136|Partnerships of all sorts are under good stars now and the next few days will bring opportunities to mend fences and get back on good terms with people you have fallen out with in recent months. Be the first to say “sorry” – they’ll appreciate it.|04-20-2014|scorpio
137|You won’t hesitate to hit back if someone does you wrong today but the problem is you may hit back at the wrong person. Think before you act and, if you do make a mistake, apologize profusely the first chance you get.|04-21-2014|scorpio
138|Everyone takes a wrong turning now and again, so don’t be surprised if the planets start nudging you in a new direction. There is an ideal path for you to take through life and in some way or other you will be reminded where it is today.|04-22-2014|scorpio
139|It may feel as if you have no control over what is going on in your life but that simply isn’t true. What is true though is that you have allowed certain people to dictate to you what you can and cannot do. It’s time to make it clear that enough is enough.|04-23-2014|scorpio
140|The planets indicate that you will gain more on every level if you take an easygoing attitude to getting your way. Aim high by all means but don’t think you have to force people to give you what it is you desire. They want you to have it.|04-24-2014|scorpio
141|You won’t be shy about letting those you care for know how much they mean to you. Creatively, too, this should be a good day for you, so let your artistic side come to the fore – it will bring you and others a great deal of joy.|04-25-2014|scorpio
142|Partners and loved ones seem to be making all the running at the moment while you follow on in their wake. But is that really so bad? You cannot expect to be a leader all of the time – sometimes you have to be a follower too.|04-26-2014|scorpio
143|You will have to adapt to other people’s plans over the next few days but it’s really no big deal. Sometimes it’s best to sit back and let others call the shots. If they get it right, that’s great. If they get it wrong, you’re not to blame.|04-27-2014|scorpio
144|Someone who is aggressive for no good reason is likely to bring out the worst in you today. No doubt they have not experienced a Scorpio’s sting before but it’s unlikely they will forget it. They’ll be a better person for it, and you’ll feel better too.|04-28-2014|scorpio
145|You will be extremely energetic today but the solar eclipse in your opposite sign of Taurus means you cannot expect to get everything your own way. Some of your rivals are every bit as relentless as you. They’re probably Scorpios too!|04-29-2014|scorpio
146|Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Taurus means you won’t get far on your own over the next few days, so let partners and loved ones and work colleagues know you need and value their support. Together you can do amazing things.|04-30-2014|scorpio
147|You have never been one for small talk and what others are wittering on about no doubt bores you to tears. Ignore them and focus your attention on what is important to you, even if no one else seems to agree. Rise above petty things.|05-01-2014|scorpio
148|Some people may be obstructive today but you don’t have to make an issue of it. Treat it as an opportunity to show how patient and relaxed you can be. Truly! Others will be impressed by your remarkable self-control.|05-02-2014|scorpio
149|The Sun links with your ruler Pluto this weekend to inspire you to go above and beyond your usual limits. Some people may try to frustrate your plans but they won’t come close to succeeding. When Scorpio wants something Scorpio gets it.|05-03-2014|scorpio
150|You are who you are for a reason, so don’t let anyone not even people you love try to persuade you that you should change your ways. You don’t need to be different, you just need to be better at who you already are.|05-04-2014|scorpio
151|If you do things by the book today you will get the rewards you deserve. If, however, you try to gain an advantage by cutting corners or telling lies most likely you will find that your underhand methods rebound on you in annoying ways.|05-05-2014|scorpio
152|Someone you encounter on your travels will turn out to be a very important contact, both on a personal level and professionally. Make an effort to get out and about and meet people and, of course, talk to them. It’s not difficult.|05-06-2014|scorpio
153|Over the next two or three days you will find it easier to get to grips with a financial matter that has been keeping you awake at night. Once you find out what the real problem is you will also find the courage to deal with it.|05-07-2014|scorpio
154|The Sun in your opposite sign of Taurus means, among other things, that you have to put up with people who annoy you. Don’t be tempted to argue with them, about anything, because if you do the situation may quickly get out of hand.|05-08-2014|scorpio
155|It does not matter how convinced you may be that you are in the right and others are in the wrong you won’t get far if you insist they come round to your way of thinking. Look for a compromise solution – it won’t be so hard to find.|05-09-2014|scorpio
156|How you deal with other people over the next 48 hours will determine whether the next few weeks will be a time of achievement or of conflict. Try to remember you are not the only one with needs and desires – or with feelings either.|05-10-2014|scorpio
157|You may find it hard to trust certain people but trust them you must. Yes, it is possible they might betray you but do you really want to let suspicion govern your every move? They’re not as bad as you think they are.|05-11-2014|scorpio
158|This is a positive and potentially passionate time for you but to make the most of it you have got to be more outgoing. Let those you are attracted to know that you are interested – don’t put on your Scorpio poker face and leave them guessing.|05-12-2014|scorpio
159|The next few days are mainly about relationships. Challenges must be dealt with and certain people must be told in no uncertain terms that you are the boss. Yes, compromise is possible, but only after you have established your authority.|05-13-2014|scorpio
160|Today’s full moon in your sign will give you the energy you need to go your own way, do your own thing and, most importantly, stand up for your right to be different. If it means you fall out with certain people, well, that’s too bad.|05-14-2014|scorpio
161|You could fall out with a work colleague or someone in authority today. It’s okay to fight your corner, of course, but be sure in your mind that you are right and they are wrong. If there’s any doubt it might be wise to back off.|05-15-2014|scorpio
162|If you need to win someone over to your way of thinking, this is the time to bombard them with facts and figures that prove your case. You will convince them more easily, of course, if there is something financial in it for them.|05-16-2014|scorpio
163|Before you reach a final decision about a long-term financial enterprise you must make sure you have all the facts at your fingertips. If you leave anything to chance there is a real possibility you will end up paying more than you should.|05-17-2014|scorpio
164|If you are the kind of Scorpio who never gives much thought to the future then what happens over the next few days will impress on you the need to look ahead. Financial planning is a must, and that means saving more and spending less.|05-18-2014|scorpio
165|You may think that life should come to you, that you are owed something by the world around you, but if that’s your attitude you will end the day disappointed. If there is something you desire make the effort to get it yourself.|05-19-2014|scorpio
166|You’ll be a bit touchy as the new week begins, perhaps due to a vague fear that a work colleague is plotting against you. Most likely there is no truth in it at all, so don’t do or say anything that might really turn them against you.|05-20-2014|scorpio
167|You seem to have got it into your head that you are entitled to something the world does not seem to want to give you. What happens today will make you realize that, in the long-term, you get only what you fight for.|05-21-2014|scorpio
168|The planets warn you may fall prey to worries and anxieties that at most others times would not bother you in the slightest. Keep telling yourself that each and every one of them is an illusion. Reality is what YOU want it to be.|05-22-2014|scorpio
169|The more you try to give up certain things you know are not good for you the more you end up indulging in them. Maybe that’s the only way. Maybe you need to wallow in what you desire until you desire it no more.|05-23-2014|scorpio
170|This could be and should be a wonderful weekend for you. With Saturn in your sign making a perfect link to Jupiter, planet of good fortune, virtually everything you do will work out for the best – so make sure you do something big.|05-24-2014|scorpio
171|You may have no choice over the next week or so but to tighten your belt financially and learn to live on less for a while. It won’t hurt as much as you think. The simple fact is you have been spending money on things you don’t need.|05-25-2014|scorpio
172|What is the most important factor in success? It’s knowing what you want, and if you still don’t know what you are aiming to do with your life you must give it some serious thought this week. Ask yourself: what do I really desire?|05-26-2014|scorpio
173|The upcoming new moon will give you the motivation and energy you need to make a start on a project you have been flirting with for weeks, months, maybe even years. There can be no more excuses: it’s time to get it done.|05-27-2014|scorpio
174|If you have been thinking of ways to make money now is the time to come to a decision about what your strategy is going to be. What you start over the next few days will reap rich rewards during the second half of the year.|05-28-2014|scorpio
175|Your creative powers will be at their height over the next 24 hours, so make good use of them. Also, take your pleasures where you find them and don’t listen to those who say you should be more cautious. Where’s the fun in that!|05-29-2014|scorpio
176|You don’t have to be the life and soul of the party and with Saturn in your sign it’s unlikely you will win any prizes for popularity. But do you care? Of course not! You rather enjoy being the odd one out – it makes you feel special.|05-30-2014|scorpio
177|You have a secret desire to do something you know will not go down well with certain people but if you don’t do it you will most likely kick yourself later for being too timid. What are you afraid of? Surely not what others might say?|05-31-2014|scorpio
178|The most important thing now is that you play by the rules. If you stray from the straight and narrow over the next few days your rivals – and you have a few – will make sure you pay for it. Make certain your tactics are squeaky clean.|06-01-2014|scorpio
179|If you are in any way dishonest when dealing with other people today they will be dishonest with you later on. You don’t need to tell lies or cut corners to get what you need, so make sure what you say and do is above suspicion.|06-02-2014|scorpio
180|Be careful you don’t lose your sense of perspective and get angry about something that would not usually bother you in the slightest. And don’t worry too much if you lose out financially either – you’ll more than make up for it later.|06-03-2014|scorpio
181|You seem to be under quite a bit of pressure at the moment and that pressure will build over the next few days. Make life easier by taking nothing too seriously, least of all yourself. Treat each challenge you face as a game. Win with a smile.|06-04-2014|scorpio
182|Stay calm and keep telling yourself that everything will come right in the end – somehow it always does. Above all don’t allow yourself to get worked up about money matters. There is no reason at all to fear the worst.|06-05-2014|scorpio
183|You may find it hard to admit you were wrong about something but you have no choice in the matter. If you have been found out for playing fast and loose with the truth you must admit it and promise not to let it happen again.|06-06-2014|scorpio
184|No doubt you have big plans and no doubt you have made all sorts of promises to yourself. This time you WILL get your act together and accomplish great things. The only danger is you may aim too high. Make sure your ambitions are realistic.|06-07-2014|scorpio
185|Don’t rush into a decision concerning a money matter or a business issue. That sense of urgency you feel is caused by the approaching full moon and is not to be trusted. If you’re not certain then wait – it won’t cost you a cent. |06-08-2014|scorpio
186|You will have a few bruises come the end of the week and maybe one or two by the end of the day. It is inevitable there will be some kind of falling out but in the greater scheme of things it’s not such a big deal. Keep smiling.|06-09-2014|scorpio
187|There is no point worrying about things over which you have no control. What will be will be, so let go of your fears and doubts and start thinking of life as a great and exciting adventure – because that is precisely what it is.|06-10-2014|scorpio
188|You may want to tear everything down and start again from scratch but is that really necessary? You may regret it in the long-term if you destroy what you have created. There is room in your life for both the old and the new.|06-11-2014|scorpio
189|The approaching full moon warns that your big ideas, while potentially profitable, need to be brought down to earth a little. Inject some reality into your thinking over the next two or three days – you won’t get rich on dreams alone.|06-12-2014|scorpio
190|There is no reason why you should not go out and have a good time but that does not mean you have to buy drinks for everyone. You have been far too generous of late, so let someone else get the check for a change.|06-13-2014|scorpio
191|You need to get serious about something you tended to treat in an offhand manner in the past. Only you know for certain what that something happens to be – and you also know if you don’t do it now it may never get done.|06-14-2014|scorpio
192|A battle of wills cannot be avoided and you MUST be the one who wins it. The outcome will decide not only the level of freedom you get to enjoy for the next few weeks but for the remainder of the year as well.|06-15-2014|scorpio
193|You need to get your financial affairs in order. If you need to cut costs then do what has to be done, even if it affects your quality of life in the short-term. The longer you leave it the harder it will be to make changes.|06-16-2014|scorpio
194|It will pay you to be skeptical today, especially when dealing with people who in some way or other depend on your generosity. Whatever it is they suggest make sure the figures add up and you are 100 per cent happy with it.|06-17-2014|scorpio
195|Even if you are the sort of Scorpio who likes to stick with tried and tested methods try to be more adventurous over the next 24 hours. Take a chance on love too. A new attraction could sweep you off your feet and transform your existence!|06-18-2014|scorpio
196|Make sure you get your chores out of the way as quickly as possible over the next 24 hours. If you let what should have been done today wait until tomorrow you will fall behind and may never catch up. Don’t put yourself under pressure.|06-19-2014|scorpio
197|You may be tempted to end a relationship that has been going through stormy seas of late but is that really a wise move? To be on the safe side wait until the Sun changes signs tomorrow. You may find that your attitude changes too.|06-20-2014|scorpio
198|Now that your financial situation is not so bad it may be tempting to go on a spree but hopefully your serious Scorpio nature will stop you from doing anything stupid. There are plenty of ways you can have fun without spending money.|06-21-2014|scorpio
199|It may seem that someone is going out of their way to make life difficult for you but most likely you are overreacting. Don’t say or do anything that might start a feud and try to remember that few things in life are straightforward.|06-22-2014|scorpio
200|You may be a bit touchy where money and possessions are concerned today. However, the planets indicate you have precious little to worry about, so lighten up and believe that it will all come right in the end – it usually does.|06-23-2014|scorpio
201|You may be in the mood to change things but the planets warn there are some things it might be wiser to leave as they are for the time being. Make changes for a reason, not just because you can (or because it annoys other people!).|06-24-2014|scorpio
202|Someone will pull rank on you today but don’t get uptight about it because there is nothing you can do to change things. Keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself, no matter how tempted you may be to speak your mind.|06-25-2014|scorpio
203|Some people complain that they never get the breaks but you know that is rarely true. What you get out of life has to be earned and over the next two or three days you will find that the more you give the more you get in return.|06-26-2014|scorpio
204|Because today’s new moon falls in one of the more expansive areas of your chart your thoughts will be remarkably positive. That’s good. What you think about now will be your reality later on, so focus only on your highest ideals.|06-27-2014|scorpio
205|The obstacles you face may be daunting but you have the know-how and the energy to overcome each and every one of them. Do not try to avoid what fate sends your way this weekend – go on the attack instead.|06-28-2014|scorpio
206|Don’t cut yourself off from other people over the next few days. Remind yourself at every opportunity that you are part of a greater whole and that no matter where you go or what you do you will never truly be alone.|06-29-2014|scorpio
207|The more others try to intimidate you today the more you must stick to your guns. They are only criticizing you this much because they fear that your ambitious plans might succeed. Stay calm and carry on – it’s the Scorpio way.|06-30-2014|scorpio
208|Chances are certain people have been leaving out facts and figures that could have made a difference to the decisions you made. Should you get angry? Well, you have every right, but has anything bad actually come of it? If no, let it go.|07-01-2014|scorpio
209|You may not want to hurt someone’s feelings but you know you have to be honest with them. There comes a time when it is necessary to tell it like it is, even if it means putting a relationship or friendship at risk. That time is now.|07-02-2014|scorpio
210|What happens today will bring a chance to make some much-needed cash but to get it you are going to have to be less conservative in your money-making ventures. You don’t have to gamble as such but try to be open to alternative possibilities.|07-03-2014|scorpio
211|If there are any loose ends in your affairs, at home or at work, you must deal with them over the next 24 hours. If you leave them flapping in the breeze they are sure to trip you up sooner or later – most likely sooner.|07-04-2014|scorpio
212|There is no point getting annoyed about things you cannot change. Even if you are the kind of Scorpio who believes that negative feelings should be expressed, there is no point getting too emotional. You need a cool mind, not a hot heart.|07-05-2014|scorpio
213|Okay, so you made a mistake, but so what? Mistakes are evidence that you are doing something, or at least trying to do something. No matter how many times you fail in the short-term you will succeed in the end – big time!|07-06-2014|scorpio
214|The planets urge you to take a less provocative approach when dealing with people you have been in disagreement with. Your differences are not so wide that you cannot find areas where you both can agree. But you’ve got to look.|07-07-2014|scorpio
215|Today’s link-up between the Sun and Uranus means you won’t hesitate to strike out in a new direction or try your hand at new activities. You have played safe too many times of late. Life is too short for not taking chances.|07-08-2014|scorpio
216|Both at home and at work you will have to watch what you say over the next 24 hours as there are some pretty fragile egos out there. You don’t need to make more enemies – you’ve got enough as it is – so think before you speak.|07-09-2014|scorpio
217|There is no point making a fuss today, not even if you can prove you have been hard done by. Sometimes we have to take what we are given and make the best of it and this is one of those times. You’ll triumph in the end.|07-10-2014|scorpio
218|Sometimes even a Scorpio has to sit back and wait for things to happen and that is the message of the stars for you now. Rest your mind and your body today because you are going to need every bit of your energy tomorrow.|07-11-2014|scorpio
219|Travel plans and social activities are under stressful influences at the moment, so don’t expect everything to go your own way this weekend. You may experience delays and disappointments now but early next week you’ll be surging ahead again.|07-12-2014|scorpio
220|Someone important will take you under their wing over the next few days and show you how to make the most of your talents. What you learn from them in the weeks and months ahead is sure to bring fame and fortune.|07-13-2014|scorpio
221|Your imaginative powers will be strong today but that will only be good news if you have a positive attitude too. If you allow the unknown to scare you then what goes on over the next 24 hours will send you scurrying for cover.|07-14-2014|scorpio
222|It might be wise to keep some of your more outrageous opinions to yourself over the next 24 hours. They may not be outrageous to you, of course, but not everyone shares your ability to see what is really going on in the world.|07-15-2014|scorpio
223|Money worries will recede over the next few days as you focus more on making a success of your work or career. Why not treat yourself to a night on the town with your friends or your family? Yes, you can afford it.|07-16-2014|scorpio
224|This is the ideal time to let your mind wander a bit because it will lead you in some interesting new directions. If you find it hard to get inspired try connecting with people who make you feel good about yourself – they’ll give you ideas.|07-17-2014|scorpio
225|You seem to be pushing yourself harder than ever of late but will achieve more in the long-term if you balance your physical and mental efforts with plenty of relaxation. Treat yourself to a massage or a day at the spa.|07-18-2014|scorpio
226|You like to be on the winning side but finishing ahead of your rivals isn’t the most important thing. If you get the chance to assist someone who is down on their luck you should take it. Helping others feel good will help you feel great.|07-19-2014|scorpio
227|The Sun’s change of signs on Tuesday will make you even more ambitious than you were before, if that is possible. There are no limits to what you can achieve now, so give yourself permission to dream – and dream big.|07-20-2014|scorpio
228|Don’t hesitate to tell others what it is you desire because someone might hand it to you on a plate. Stranger things have happened and will continue to happen over the next few weeks, so be ready and expect anything – and everything!|07-21-2014|scorpio
229|Your self-esteem will receive some kind of boost over the next 24 hours, making it easier for you to deal with important people. The thing to bear in mind is that the powers that be want you to succeed and you must want it too.|07-22-2014|scorpio
230|Everyone has a story worth hearing and if you pay attention to what a friend or colleague tells you today you will learn something to your advantage. At the very least you will avoid making the same kind of mistake.|07-23-2014|scorpio
231|Current influences will give a much-needed boost to your ambitions but success won’t just land in your lap. You will have to work for your rewards but that’s okay because no one has more strength and stamina than Scorpio. Go for it!|07-24-2014|scorpio
232|It’s not like you to let others have the last word but it will pay you to do so today. Even if you can quite easily prove someone wrong you are advised not to do so because they will remember it and harbor thoughts of revenge.|07-25-2014|scorpio
233|As Mars moves into your birth sign this weekend you may be tempted to tear everything down and start again from scratch but is that such a good idea? Don’t waste all your previous efforts – strengthen them and build on them.|07-26-2014|scorpio
234|It is not enough to assume that other people know what you are talking about – spell it out for them in plain and simple language so there can be no confusion. You have an important message to convey, so make the effort and get it right.|07-27-2014|scorpio
235|Stop worrying what other people might think about you. You are who you are for a good cosmic reason and no one has any right to suggest you be something else. That won’t stop them trying, of course, but they can’t force you to listen.|07-28-2014|scorpio
236|The planets make it easy for you to approach people in positions of power today but if you have some kind of proposal to make it must be well thought out because they won’t be impressed if it is easy to pick holes in your plan.|07-29-2014|scorpio
237|If you approach a task in a negative frame of mind today then, inevitably, you won’t much enjoy it. But if you can find a way to pretend you have been really looking forward to it then it might surprise you how easy it is.|07-30-2014|scorpio
238|Try something you have never done before, something risky and maybe even a little bit outrageous. Others may not approve but, if anything, that will make you even more determined to go through with it. Scorpios can be SO stubborn!|07-31-2014|scorpio
239|What is your number one ambition in life? Are you close to making it come true? If not, don’t worry because the planets promise there is plenty of time. Take each day as it comes and move forward one step at a time. You’ll get there.|08-01-2014|scorpio
240|By all means look up to someone but don’t for a minute believe that they can do no wrong – because they will prove you wrong! The planets warn that your respect for a certain individual is based more on emotion than logic.|08-02-2014|scorpio
241|Make it your aim over the next few days to identify the two or three goals that mean the most to you – then focus on them to the exclusion of everything else. Play to your strengths. The more intense you are the more successful you will be.|08-03-2014|scorpio
242|Usually you are happy to stand aside and let others argue the toss about trivial issues but according to the planets something small has got you riled in a big way and you intend to have your say. Watch out world – Scorpio’s on the warpath!|08-04-2014|scorpio
243|Authority figures will be impressed by your ability not only to get things done but to get along with a wide range of people while doing it. You will make difficult tasks looks easy – and make yourself look good – over the next 24 hours.|08-05-2014|scorpio
244|The approaching full moon will make everyone a bit touchy over the next few days, so make allowances for them and make allowances for yourself as well. By this time next week most people, you included, will be cool and calm again.|08-06-2014|scorpio
245|Mars in your sign indicates that the quickest way to get the results you desire is to go all out to transform your current situation. Drastic decisions will have to be made and, having made them, your life won’t be the same again – but much, much better.|08-07-2014|scorpio
246|A career change of some kind is likely very soon. Whether it is a change you make for yourself or a change that is forced on you remains to be seen but if you do feel so inclined then by all means make the first move.|08-08-2014|scorpio
247|Some of the best partnerships are between people who appear to have little in common, so don’t turn down an invitation this weekend just because it’s from someone you find a bit weird. Chances are it will be a huge success.|08-09-2014|scorpio
248|It seems you are trying too hard to please one particular person and because of that other people are beginning to feel neglected. That may not be your intention but you need to be more even-handed, or at least pretend to be.|08-10-2014|scorpio
249|You must knuckle down and get something you promised you would finish out of the way before the end of the day. Once it is done you can forget about it completely and turn to the things you want to do with a clear conscience.|08-11-2014|scorpio
250|It won’t be long before you have to make a choice between a personal relationship and your work. You won’t have to give up one for the other as such but you will need to focus in a single direction. It’s about to get serious.|08-12-2014|scorpio
251|You have a reputation for keeping your head in difficult situations and it’s a reputation that will be called on at some point today. Whatever it is that excites other people it won’t move you in the slightest. You’re rock solid.|08-13-2014|scorpio
252|You have the power to reach out and take whatever it is you want to possess, so what are you waiting for? Don’t let other people’s doubts hold you back because if you hesitate the chance will be gone. Seize the moment!|08-14-2014|scorpio
253|More than any other sign you have the power to make things happen, not least by using your ability to influence how people think. Your task today, and over the weekend, is to point out new possibilities . Be a catalyst for change. |08-15-2014|scorpio
254|Someone you socialize with is secretly jealous of your popularity. That won’t mean anything to you so long as they don’t try to talk you down but if they do you must act fast. Rumors, no matter how wrong, can spread amazingly fast.|08-16-2014|scorpio
255|Anyone who tries to trick you over the next two or three days will find out just how unwise it can be to play games with a Scorpio. You have a knack for knowing when others are up to no good – and you’re not afraid to act on it.|08-17-2014|scorpio
256|You may feel good about yourself but not everyone is as positive as you and someone you love is in need of a confidence booster. Use your sharp wit to bring back the smile to their face. They won’t be feeling under the weather for long.|08-18-2014|scorpio
257|You may want to show that you can manage on your own but today’s challenges are likely to be severe, so see sense and make sure you have back-up from friends and family before taking on what may be too much for you alone.|08-19-2014|scorpio
258|Don’t give up on something just because you have grown bored with it. Certain tasks may be a bit of a grind but that does not mean they have to be tedious. Use your intelligence to find ways to spice them up a bit.|08-20-2014|scorpio
259|No one has the right to tell you what to believe and what not to believe and if they try you must come down on them hard. Having said that, you may find that something you used to believe in no longer seems quite so certain.|08-22-2014|scorpio
260|You will finish what you are working on a lot quicker if you get help. You may think you can do it all on your own but you are kidding no one but yourself. Share the effort – and there will be plenty of glory to share as well.|08-24-2014|scorpio
261|Try to find common ground with a group of people you have not always seen eye-to-eye with in the past. You actually share many things in common and if you can overcome your more obvious differences you can do great things together.|08-26-2014|scorpio
262|Stay on good terms with the people you work with. The planets warn if you try to improve your position at someone else’s expense, not only will you fail but you will make an enemy for life. You can do without that.|08-27-2014|scorpio
263|You could be a bit too aggressive today, which could have unintended consequences. Try not to take anything too seriously and try not to take what others say personally. Once you lose your cool you will have a hard time finding it again.|08-28-2014|scorpio
264|Like it or not you will have to adapt to what other people do – no way will they even consider adapting to you! Fortunately, with Mercury moving in your favor there won’t be so many misunderstandings as there have been in recent weeks.|08-29-2014|scorpio
265|You will get more done over the next two days than you usually get done in two weeks, but don’t run yourself ragged. You have your limits like everyone else and if you go too far beyond them you will end up paying the price.|08-30-2014|scorpio
266|Today’s moon-Saturn link could have a negative effect on your self-image. You don’t think you are as skilled or experienced as your rivals? Well you’re wrong. You have what it takes and more besides. Believe in yourself and make things happen. |08-31-2014|scorpio
267|Mars in your sign makes you want to get things done in the world, but other aspects suggest it might be smart to withdraw from the everyday hustle and bustle for a while. Act less but think more over the next few days.|09-01-2014|scorpio
268|There is a danger that in your enthusiasm to show what you can do you will take on too many tasks and spread yourself too thin. Focus on the one thing you are naturally good at today. Make your number one talent your fortune.|09-02-2014|scorpio
269|Friends and social activities will bring you luck over the next 24 hours, so don’t sit at home doing nothing, get out into the world and make an impression. The more attention you get, personally and professionally, the more you will accomplish.|09-03-2014|scorpio
270|There is a task of some kind you have yet to complete and over the next 24 hours you must decide whether to carry on with it or whether to give up on it. Clearly it doesn’t inspire you enough, so why not just let it go?|09-04-2014|scorpio
271|You cannot go on trying to achieve everything alone – it just isn’t going to work. With Venus moving into the friendship area of your chart this weekend making alliances will come easy to you – so don’t be so stand-offish!|09-05-2014|scorpio
272|The best way to deal with an emotional problem is to throw yourself into activities which keep both your mind and your body occupied. The less you think about your problems the more distant they will become. Eventually they will disappear.|09-06-2014|scorpio
273|If you decide to get more deeply involved in some kind of movement or cause you must go all the way – there can be no half measures. Serious subjects require a serious attitude – and they don’t come more serious than Scorpio!|09-07-2014|scorpio
274|A secret admirer will be secret no longer by the end of the day. If your feelings for them are as strong as their feelings for you this will be a marvelous week. If not . . . find a way to put them off without being brutal.|09-08-2014|scorpio
275|You are going through a positive phase at the moment, so if there are things in your life you want to change now is the time. Some people will try to dissuade you but only because they fear you will leave them behind. They’re right, you will.|09-09-2014|scorpio
276|No matter how attached you are to a particular idea, something will happen over the next 24 hours that forces you to think again. Could it be you took certain things for granted that you now realize were simply not true? Yes, it could.|09-10-2014|scorpio
277|You may be convinced that your way of doing things is best but you still need to explain and justify your actions to partners and co-workers if you want to get important things done. They won’t just follow you out of blind loyalty you know!|09-11-2014|scorpio
278|This will be a day of fun and pleasant surprises, but make the most of it because Mars will be disrupting things a bit over the weekend. If you think there is something you can do to reduce the chances of disorder then do it now.|09-12-2014|scorpio
279|If money matters are in a bit of a muddle at the moment don’t worry, you will soon get the chance to sort things out. Mars in the money area of your chart over the next few weeks will force you to get serious about your finances.|09-13-2014|scorpio
280|Try changing your point of view this week. Often by looking at an issue from a different angle the solution becomes obvious, and that applies to work problems as much as it does to personal matters. Never allow your viewpoint to harden. Always be flexible.|09-14-2014|scorpio
281|Think positively about what you are required to do by people in positions of authority. It may not be what you want to do but the bottom line is they have the power and you do not. Don’t start a battle you cannot possibly win.|09-15-2014|scorpio
282|You may be unaware that someone is annoyed with you but you’ll find out soon enough. If a loved one or work colleague gives you a hard time over the next 24 hours try to find out why. Was it something you said or did?|09-16-2014|scorpio
283|Are you delighted with what you have achieved? Or are you saddened because you wasted so many opportunities? Either way you should not get too worked up about it. You will always get another chance – and another, and another after that.|09-17-2014|scorpio
284|What you get over the next 24 hours may not be what you want precisely but according to the planets it is exactly what you need. If a friend makes a suggestion you would be wise to take it seriously. They know what you need too.|09-18-2014|scorpio
285|Something that made perfect sense a short while ago now seems to make no sense at all and it’s immensely frustrating. Don’t worry about it. A day or two from now you will have forgotten why you thought it was so important.|09-19-2014|scorpio
286|You need to be open and honest about your desires. Being a secretive Scorpio it won’t come easy to you but unless you let others know how you feel they won’t be able to respond the way you want them to respond. At least drop a few hints.|09-20-2014|scorpio
287|You won’t find it easy to express yourself over the next 24 hours, but that’s okay – you’re not exactly renowned for your conversation. Keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself and only speak when what you have to say is of real importance.|09-21-2014|scorpio
288|It does not matter how much you own or how much you earn – if you are happy with your lot then you don’t need a lot. Bear that thought in mind over the next few days. Material things are not important but emotional and spiritual things are.|09-22-2014|scorpio
289|The difficulties you are encountering are not designed to weaken you but to toughen you up for the challenges that lie ahead. The Sun in Libra over the next few weeks will pose many questions, but deep down you already know all the answers.|09-23-2014|scorpio
290|Although today’s new moon takes place in the most sensitive area of your chart there is nothing you should be too worried about. You may have to give up something you are attached to but deep down you know it’s no longer worth the effort.|09-24-2014|scorpio
291|Domestic and work arrangements may change at a moment’s notice today, but that’s okay. You are adaptable enough to change with them and make it all seem effortless – which won’t go unnoticed by people in positions of power.|09-25-2014|scorpio
292|Saturn in your sign does not seem quite so restrictive of late but that does not mean you can loosen your hold on the purse strings. In a matter of days a new source of income will present itself – then you can have a bit of a splurge.|09-26-2014|scorpio
293|Your ability to satisfy your desires this weekend will be in direct proportion to your ability to communicate what it is you are after. Spell out to others what it is you need in plain and simple language and the universe will make it happen.|09-27-2014|scorpio
294|You may have to guard against disappointment over the next few days, not because you have anything to be disappointed about as such but because the Sun in Libra at this time of year makes you fear the worst. Don’t worry, it won’t happen.|09-28-2014|scorpio
295|What would you change in your life if you knew you had the power to make it happen? Whatever that something happens to be you must start thinking and feeling as if it will do whatever you tell it to do. Your mind creates your reality.|09-29-2014|scorpio
296|Don’t give up on a new enterprise because it is more difficult than you expected it to be. You know from experience that the more you practice something the easier it becomes, so give it time. Don’t expect too much of yourself too soon.|09-30-2014|scorpio
297|What you do in private today is more important than what you do in public, especially as it will help build emotional bonds with people you may have neglected in recent months. Fame may be fun but it can’t beat real human contact.|10-01-2014|scorpio
298|It seems you are having second thoughts about some kind of plan or project. Yes, it’s going to be tougher than you expected. Have faith in your abilities and be willing to work harder than everyone else. You’ll triumph eventually.|10-02-2014|scorpio
299|The best way to handle a delicate situation is to be brutal with it. That may sound all wrong but the planets indicate that you have been pussy-footing round an issue when you should have got to grips with it. You don’t need tact, you need action.|10-03-2014|scorpio
300|A goal you have been working towards will soon be in front of you and you will be so pleased you stuck it through to the end. Unlike some people you never give in and there are sure to be a few envious eyes on you this weekend.|10-04-2014|scorpio
301|You may not see the point in what you are being asked to do but you will do it anyway, simply because you accept it as your duty. It’s a shame more people are not as principled and committed as you. The world would be a better place.|10-05-2014|scorpio
302|Your enthusiasm for a plan or project is likely to wane over the next few days, but that’s okay. You gave it your best shot and that is all you can ask of yourself. Not even a Scorpio can get it spot on every time.|10-06-2014|scorpio
303|There is no need for regrets or remorse. You cannot turn the clock back so you might as well set your sights on the future and make it the best it can possibly be. Yesterday is gone and today will follow it soon – it’s tomorrow that matters.|10-07-2014|scorpio
304|What happens today may be a challenge to your ego but no way is it going to break you, so don’t fret. These are difficult times but you can make things easier for yourself by going with the flow rather than fighting against it.|10-08-2014|scorpio
305|Because mind planet Mercury is moving retrograde at the moment it will take a concentrated mental effort not to give in to feelings of doom and gloom. It is an effort worth making, because there are so many wonderful things to look forward to.|10-09-2014|scorpio
306|Take time out today to ponder the decision you are about to make. Is it really what you want? Are you acting rationally or are your emotions involved? If you are not completely convinced you are doing the right thing then maybe you should wait.|10-10-2014|scorpio
307|Whatever plans or schedules you may have drawn up in recent weeks you are advised to rip them all up and dump them in the waste bin. Changes will come thick and fast over the next few days, so try just to live in the moment.|10-11-2014|scorpio
308|You may not know why a hunch is so strong but you know better than to ignore it. You won’t know for certain if you have made the right choice until later in the week but deep down you can sense you are on to a winner.|10-12-2014|scorpio
309|You know what needs to be done to improve your status, so why are you holding back? Maybe it’s because you realize, deep down, that status is not so important after all, especially if you have to sacrifice your principles to get it.|10-13-2014|scorpio
310|Withdraw from the hustle and bustle of life and find room to think and feel more deeply than has been the case of late. Just over a week from now a new solar year begins for you, so make sure your head and your heart are in a good place.|10-14-2014|scorpio
311|Yes, times may be tough but it’s nothing you cannot handle. As the Sun nears the end of one Scorpio solar cycle you must expect things to be a bit gray and glum but it’s okay: a few days from now your fortunes will be transformed.|10-15-2014|scorpio
312|The planets will help you see through the web of deceit that certain people have created and by the end of the day you will have no doubt what the truth is. After that it is simply a question of what you are going to do about it.|10-16-2014|scorpio
313|Today’s cosmic set-up warns you cannot afford to be half-hearted or only half involved. Friends and family and work colleagues expect total commitment and you owe it to them to give 100 per cent. Fortunately, a Scorpio rarely gives less.|10-17-2014|scorpio
314|The Sun’s move into your birth sign on Thursday is followed immediately by a solar eclipse – an excellent omen of personal and professional success. Decide what it is you want to improve in your life, then just do it. Yes, it really is that easy. |10-19-2014|scorpio
315|You seem to be having serious misgivings about what a friend or family member is proposing to do and it is your duty to speak up about it. They may resent your interference now but later on they will thank you profusely.|10-20-2014|scorpio
316|The next few weeks promise to be both happy and exciting. Tomorrow’s solar eclipse in your sign will do wonders for your confidence and give you the courage to start something that could and should transform your existence. Be bold.|10-22-2014|scorpio
317|The Sun enters your birth sign today and there is also a powerful eclipse in your sign, so the omens are good, in fact they are excellent. There are genuinely no limits to what you can accomplish over the next four weeks or so.|10-23-2014|scorpio
318|Life moves in never-ending cycles and because the cycle you have now entered on is positive in the extreme you have every right to feel pleased with yourself. You don’t have to do anything special today, just be yourself – and smile often.|10-24-2014|scorpio
319|If you feel the urge to get out and about and socialize a bit then by all means do so. Mars, planet of energy, moves into the most restless area of your chart this weekend, so go where your instincts take you and enjoy every moment of it.|10-25-2014|scorpio
320|Mars, planet of action and energy, moves into the most outgoing area of your chart on your birthday, making is easier for you to reach out to other people. Be daring and dynamic by all means but don’t forget about feelings – your own and other people’s. |10-26-2014|scorpio
321|Whatever happened to all those plans and promises you made to yourself earlier in the year? Whatever the answer the good news is you are now in the ideal position to do something about them. Go after your dream. Better late than never.|10-27-2014|scorpio
322|Neptune, planet of imagination, is strong on your birthday this year, so listen to what your inner voice tells you, then act on it as if it is the most natural thing in the world. All things are possible. If you can visualize it you can create it – it’s really that simple.|10-28-2014|scorpio
323|Don’t worry if you have been feeling a bit disillusioned of late because what happens over the next 12 months will remind you how good life can be. It will be even better if you shift your focus away from material things and towards people and relationships.|10-29-2014|scorpio
324|It may at seems seem as if your life is going nowhere but that isn’t true – in fact you are making amazing progress. Your plan for the coming year must be to get the most from each passing moment. The future is not tomorrow, the future is right now.|10-30-2014|scorpio
325|You may strongly disagree with someone’s views but keep your feelings about it to yourself. Once you get into an argument it could snowball faster than you expected and neither you nor your opponent is in the mood to back down. Trouble|11-02-2014|scorpio
326|A Sun-Pluto link on your birthday will endow you with all the confidence and all the energy you need to do remarkable things over the coming 12 months. One thing you do need is to socialize more with like-minded people. Together you are unbeatable|11-03-2014|scorpio
327|The more someone tells you that your plans are not going to work the more determined you will be to see them through to completion. You feel you have something to prove, not only to them but to yourself as well.|11-04-2014|scorpio
328|A difficult situation is set to continue for some while yet – all you can do is soldier on and deal with it as best you can. Changes may be worrying but in the long-term you will be glad you were forced to move in a new direction. |11-05-2014|scorpio
329|Today’s full moon in your opposite sign suggests that a relationship of some kind is going through a bumpy phase. Don’t give up on it yet because a few days from now you will look back and realize how trivial your differences are.|11-06-2014|scorpio
330|The intensity of your feelings can no longer be denied or disguised. You may have purposely kept your distance from someone because you did not know how you might react but the planets will throw you together today. Your relationship is fated.|11-07-2014|scorpio
331|As mind planet Mercury moves into your sign you will at last be able to understand things that in the past left you confused. But don’t fall into the trap of thinking you know it all – there is always something new to learn.|11-08-2014|scorpio
332|You may want to tell people what you are up to and what you expect to achieve but the planets suggest you would be wise to keep it to yourself for a few more days. You don’t want their negative reactions to disappoint you.|11-09-2014|scorpio
333|You should by now have overcome whatever fears and worries were holding you back, but if something is still bothering you then you must deal with it today. Pluto will help you to be ruthless with yourself – but you must be kind to other people.|11-10-2014|scorpio
334|Don’t be afraid to explore ideas that certain people say should be out of bounds. If you let them set the agenda then you put yourself at a massive disadvantage. You are under no obligation to think or feel as they do.|11-11-2014|scorpio
335|You seem to be living a charmed life at the moment – you can apparently talk your way out of any and every difficult situation. Be that as it may don’t say things you know are not true merely for the fun of it. There will be consequences.|11-12-2014|scorpio
336|No matter who depends on you there are certain things you must do for yourself over the next 24 hours. An opportunity to improve your status and reputation must be seized immediately or someone else will take it and benefit at your expense.|11-13-2014|scorpio
337|Every new turn you take seems to lead further away from what you are aiming for, which is frustrating. Could it be that your subconscious mind is trying to warn you that what you are aiming for is perhaps not so desirable? Think about it.|11-14-2014|scorpio
338|Don’t waste time arguing about things that will never make much of a difference. It may feel as if certain people are deliberately trying to wind you up – and maybe they are – but you should take it all in your stride. That’s life.|11-15-2014|scorpio
339|So long as you are neither too anxious nor too confident this week you will make amazing progress. Tuesday’s Sun-Saturn link suggests a reward very much worth having for all your recent efforts. You worked for it, so you deserve it.|11-16-2014|scorpio
340|Your mind is awash with brilliant ideas but you seem reluctant to do much with them. Maybe that’s because you don’t want to begin new projects in a rush of enthusiasm only to lose interest in them later. Take your time and get it right.|11-17-2014|scorpio
341|If you want to achieve something special between now and the end of the year then you must set yourself targets that are not too easy to reach. Today’s Sun-Saturn link in your sign means you are capable of efforts above and beyond the norm.|11-18-2014|scorpio
342|With so much energy at your disposal right now you don’t have to stick to the same old routines. Whatever natural talents you possess – and you possess more than most people – you can and you must make them work for you. |11-19-2014|scorpio
343|You can charm the birds out of the trees if you put your mind to it today. Some situations call for subtlety, some call for assertiveness, but whatever circumstances you face over the next 24 hours you’ll come up smelling of roses. |11-20-2014|scorpio
344|You have never been the sort to worry too much about what other people think of you, and that’s good. You would, however, be wise to pay attention to a loved one’s criticisms today. If you are honest you will admit they have a point.|11-21-2014|scorpio
345|Just because someone occupies a position of power does not mean they have to be obeyed without question. On the contrary, if you can see they are abusing their position you have a duty to speak up. Are you brave enough to do that? |11-22-2014|scorpio
346|You cannot change the past but you can change the way you react to events in the here and now. Focus on what you have to do today and let tomorrow take care of itself. The less you worry now the better the future will be.|11-23-2014|scorpio
347|You need to be careful as the new week begins because if you allow yourself to be taken in by soft words or a pretty face you could find later on that you have been duped. It may pay you to be a bit suspicious. |11-24-2014|scorpio
348|An important relationship will take a turn for the better over the next 24 hours, especially if you openly communicate your feelings. Loved ones will be more responsive to your needs if they are confident they know what they are. |11-25-2014|scorpio
349|You have made a lot of sacrifices in recent weeks and today’s Mercury-Saturn union in your sign indicates there is something else you must do before you can move on to pastures new. Do what is expected of you and do it with a smile.|11-26-2014|scorpio
350|What happens over the next 24 hours will confirm what you have long suspected – that it is a mistake to limit yourself in any way. Old ways of doing things are unlikely to make your world better – but new methods will.|11-27-2014|scorpio
351|As Mercury moves into the money area of your chart today you are free to make changes to your financial or business situation. Yes, of course, you will have to take other people’s needs into account but your own needs must still come first.|11-28-2014|scorpio
352|The most important thing this weekend is that you raise your sights, not just a bit but to the highest possible level. There is no limit to what you can achieve but it’s unlikely you will get far if you keep selling yourself short. Be brilliant!|11-29-2014|scorpio
353|Usually you are choosy about your companions but for some reason you don’t seem to care who you hang out with at the moment. That’s your choice, of course, but watch out you don’t get caught up in trouble that is not of your making.|11-30-2014|scorpio
354|An objective may not have been within your reach in the past but it will certainly be within your reach over the next few days. All you have to do is put a name to your dream and then extend your hand to grasp it. |12-01-2014|scorpio
355|There is no point throwing yourself at something you simply don’t enjoy doing. The planets indicate that it may be time for a change – and a big change at that. What is it that YOU want to do? Then do it, and nothing else!  |12-02-2014|scorpio
356|Don’t deny yourself anything over the next 24 hours. If you crave for something then let yourself have it. Yes, there may be a touch of guilt involved but that will only add to your enjoyment. You like to break the rules. |12-03-2014|scorpio
357|You may be in a serious frame of mind at the moment but not everyone shares your solemn outlook, nor is there any reason why they should. Have you considered the possibility that they’ve got it right and you’ve got it wrong? |12-04-2014|scorpio
358|You may be rather emotional over the next two or three days but what of it? Even a Libra is allowed to shed a few tears now and again – and the planets indicate they are just as likely to be tears of joy as tears of sorrow.|12-05-2014|scorpio
359|You may be tempted to make a commitment of some kind but with a particularly sensitive full moon this weekend you are advised to leave it a while. You are more likely to make a correct decision early next week when your mind is clear.|12-06-2014|scorpio
360|You need to look beneath the surface of events if you want to find out what is really going on. The signposts may be subtle and easily missed out but no one is better than Scorpio at digging deep to find the hidden truth.|12-07-2014|scorpio
361|Whatever challenges you are faced with over the next few days you will attack them and batter them into submission. But don’t get carried away and take on something (or someone) that is out of your league. Even a Scorpio has limits.|12-08-2014|scorpio
362|You need to let go of things you no longer need, especially things that have become a drain on your time and energy. You don’t have to ask anyone’s permission to make changes – it’s your life, so take full control of it. |12-09-2014|scorpio
363|What you say today will have far-reaching effects for months to come, so think before you speak and strive to be positive at all times. You don’t have to lie to people but you should certainly talk up what’s good and play down what’s bad. |12-10-2014|scorpio
364|Look and act confident today, even though you may not feel it inside. If your rivals detect fear they will be after you in an instant. Keep telling yourself that you have what it takes to succeed. Say it enough and you will start to believe it.|12-11-2014|scorpio
365|You need to tie up a number of loose ends today if you are to get the full benefit of what occurs over the weekend. Resolve your differences with colleagues at work and bring a project to a speedy and successful conclusion.|12-12-2014|scorpio
366|You can easily get what you want this weekend, simply by asking the right people in the right way. You have so much charm at your disposal now that there is precious little anyone will deny you. Does that get you thinking? It should!|12-13-2014|scorpio
367|You will find it very difficult to hide your feelings this week, much as you might want to. Something will happen that annoys you so much that you can’t help but have a go at those you believe are responsible – and you are right to do so.|12-14-2014|scorpio
368|Let everyone know what you expect of them today. Some may grumble and say you are exceeding your powers, and maybe you are, but rather that than have them think you are weak. You’re a Scorpio – you are supposed to be domineering! |12-15-2014|scorpio
369|The more others say something cannot be done the more determined you will be to prove them wrong. Just be careful you don’t take on something that is beyond even your formidable powers to make a success of. |12-16-2014|scorpio
370|If you have something on your mind you must let others know about it. Yes, you may go too far and make more of it than you should but that is preferable to not going far enough and giving the impression that everything is okay. |12-17-2014|scorpio
371|Someone you work or do business with will disagree with your plans today but there is no way you are going to change them. Smile sweetly and tell them you understand their concerns – then carry on exactly the same as before. |12-18-2014|scorpio
372|A loved one will demand that you spend more time with them today and if you are smart you will agree. This is one of those occasions when if you’re nice to them now they will be even nicer to you later. It’s a sacrifice worth making.|12-19-2014|scorpio
373|As the Sun moves into the communication area of your chart this weekend you should have no trouble putting across your point of view. Say what you have to say simply and don’t force others to agree with you. They’ll “get it” eventually. |12-20-2014|scorpio
374|Tomorrow’s new moon falls in the most open and outgoing area of your chart, so the next few days should be truly magical. If you get the chance to visit relatives or friends you have not seen in a while don’t hesitate, just go.|12-21-2014|scorpio
375|Wherever you go and whatever you do today you will meet people who inspire you to be bigger and better. You will also, in your own small way, be an inspiration to others, especially those who admire your willingness to take risks. |12-22-2014|scorpio
376|Travel and social activities will be a lot of fun over the holiday period but the ride won’t always be smooth. If you are visiting friends or relatives in faraway places make sure you plan ahead and give yourself plenty of time.|12-23-2014|scorpio
377|According to your solar chart this is a good day for doing nothing much, so sit back, relax and let life come to you. Your confidence is improving by the minute and the only danger is you might end up with too much self-belief! |12-24-2014|scorpio
378|A little bit of effort will yield remarkable results over the next few days, so decide what it is you are going to do then do it to the best of your abilities. And don’t be cautious. This is very much a time for trying new things.|12-25-2014|scorpio
379|According to the planets a loved one is getting emotional for no good reason and it is up to you to calm them down and help them see sense again. Everyone should have someone like you to hold their hand and ease their fears. |12-26-2014|scorpio
380|Keep things simple if you want to have fun. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to travel and social plans. It’s unlikely you are in the mood for too much moving about, so look for your entertainment closer to home.|12-27-2014|scorpio
381|Anyone who thinks they can tell you how to think and what to feel obviously has no idea what sort of person you are but they will find out soon enough – and it could be a rather steep learning curve! No one dictates to a Scorpio.|12-28-2014|scorpio
382|This may be a confusing day on the work front as signals get jumbled and no one seems to know what is really going on. Your best course of action is to ignore what others say you should do and follow your instincts instead. |12-29-2014|scorpio
383|Your luck is good at the moment and today’s Mercury-Jupiter link will bring good news concerning your work or career. However, as Jupiter is moving retrograde at the moment you are advised not take anything for granted – further changes are coming. |12-30-2014|scorpio
384|A lot of people will do a lot of silly things today but there is no reason why you should join in the madness. Aim to do the opposite of what everyone else is doing – and the new year will start on the right sort of high.|12-31-2014|scorpio
385|A family problem won’t be so much of an issue as the new year gets underway. Chances are it was never that important anyway but sometimes you build things up to be bigger than they really are. Worry less and enjoy life more. |01-01-2015|scorpio
386|If you have something to say then say it and don’t worry what others might think. Almost inevitably your words will upset someone but that’s their fault for being so touchy. Likewise, don’t get uptight if someone says things about you. |01-02-2015|scorpio
387|This is a good time for family matters and if you let loved ones know how much you care and how much you appreciate them it could be one of the best weekends for a very long time – and a great way to start the year. |01-03-2015|scorpio
388|You will be lucky in love this week – and loved ones will be lucky for you. Travel and social plans may be disrupted slightly because of the full moon but delays will only be minor, so stay calm – you’ll still get there on time.|01-04-2015|scorpio
389|Keep things simple over the next 24 hours, especially if you are on the move. Travel and social plans could easily go wrong, so give yourself plenty of time and have a Route B ready in case Route A is blocked. |01-05-2015|scorpio
390|Where you are coming from may seem important but it pales into insignificance when measured beside where you are going to. It does not matter what level you are on at this moment, you are very much on the up. So keep climbing. |01-06-2015|scorpio
391|You are so full of energy at the moment but don’t expect other people to be as active or ambitious as you. Just because you are racing here, there and everywhere does not mean everyone else has to follow your lead. |01-07-2015|scorpio
392|You need to streamline your working routine and you need to do so now. The first thing you must do is decide how much you can comfortably cope with. The second thing is to simply refuse to take on anything more than that. |01-08-2015|scorpio
393|If you allow personal feelings to influence the decisions you make today at least one of those decisions will cause you grief. Stick to the facts and avoid wishful thinking. You have a reputation for common sense. Show you deserve it. |01-09-2015|scorpio
394|No way will you adopt a low profile this weekend. You are full of yourself at the moment and don’t care what sort of an impression you make so long as it’s a big one. By all means show off a bit.|01-10-2015|scorpio
395|Anyone who expects you to compromise over the next few days is going to be disappointed. You are in one of your dynamic moods at the moment and you have no intention of bending even an inch to please other people. |01-11-2015|scorpio
396|This is potentially one of the best times of the year for you and anything of a creative, artistic or romantic nature is sure to go well over the next few days. You don’t have to ask anyone’s permission to do what makes you feel good. |01-12-2015|scorpio
397|You may have strong opinions about certain issues but what happens today and tomorrow will force you to question some of your long-held beliefs. Maybe you should move with the times – it doesn’t have to be painful.|01-13-2015|scorpio
398|Nothing is beyond you. All things are possible. That may sound too good to be true but you really can accomplish something remarkable over the next two or three days, simply by following your dream. Turn it into a reality. |01-14-2015|scorpio
399|You are in one of your assertive moods today and if others have any sense they will give you whatever you demand with no questions asked. Just be careful you don’t annoy someone whose cooperation you may need in the near future. |01-15-2015|scorpio
400|Your luck will turn for the better very soon but today and over the weekend you must be cautious, especially when traveling and dealing with people whose motives you know little about. Don’t give anything away for free. |01-16-2015|scorpio
401|The planets signal that some kind of breakthrough is likely but it will come more quickly if you are deliberately assertive. Remember though, that assertive does not mean aggressive. You want to win people over, not turn them against you. |01-17-2015|scorpio
402|Try to put other people’s needs first as much as possible, because if you do favors for them now they will do you no end of favors over the next few weeks. Focus on getting your home life sorted – everything else follows from that.|01-18-2015|scorpio
403|If you speak your mind today you will get away with it no matter how outrageous your comments may be. If you speak your mind tomorrow or the day after there may be negative consequences. Think before you speak or don’t speak at all. |01-19-2015|scorpio
404|Put other people’s needs first today and tomorrow, because if you do a favor for partners and loved ones now they will do no end of favors for you over the next few weeks. Focus first on getting your home life sorted. |01-20-2015|scorpio
405|It may be hard to stay calm and in control of yourself if someone in a position of authority gives you a hard time but chances are they are winding you up on purpose, just to see how you react. Don’t fall for their tricks. |01-21-2015|scorpio
406|You won’t find it hard to knuckle down and get things done today and tomorrow but try to remember that not everyone is as motivated as you. In a way that’s good because it gives you an excuse to work on your own, which you prefer.|01-22-2015|scorpio
407|You don’t usually lack in the common sense department but today you will do something entirely illogical. Others will be surprised, to say the least, but maybe that’s the idea – maybe you are doing it on purpose!|01-23-2015|scorpio
408|There may be no end of fun things going on socially this weekend but you must put partners and loved ones first, even if it means letting down your buddies. Harmony at home is by far the most important thing at the moment. |01-24-2015|scorpio
409|Watch what you say, and the way in which you say it, because your words could easily be taken the wrong way. Venus in the most creative area of your chart from Tuesday will improve your mood considerably, which will help. |01-25-2015|scorpio
410|The planets warn this is not a good time to take chances as cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart is clouding your ability to separate fact from fiction. Why take chances when you have what you need already? |01-26-2015|scorpio
411|You may want to do things for other people but make sure they want to be helped before you invest your precious time and energy in them. Think more about your own needs today, especially your creative and romantic desires.|01-27-2015|scorpio
412|A money-making idea may seem to be the answer to your prayers but as mind planet Mercury is going through one of its retrograde phases it will pay to be cautious. Is there a potentially large expense you have somehow managed to overlook?|01-28-2015|scorpio
413|It does not matter how many mistakes you have made or how many times you have failed, it matters only that you are still alive and kicking and ready to rejoin the fray. You can never keep a Scorpio down for long. |01-29-2015|scorpio
414|You have a simple choice today and over the weekend: either you stand by your principles and lose out financially or you reject your ideals and make lots of money. Ask yourself this: how much will it cost you to buy your principles back? |01-30-2015|scorpio
415|With Mercury still moving retrograde it’s unlikely that everything will go smoothly over the next few days. But don’t make a big deal of delays and disruptions either. You are still moving generally, though slowly, in the right direction. |01-31-2015|scorpio
416|There will be some strong emotions in the air over the next few days and if you are not very careful you could get swept away by it all. Both in your private life and on the work front you must keep a grip on reality.|02-01-2015|scorpio
417|If someone gets a bit aggressive in their attempts to sell you something you don’t want, be it a physical object or an idea, be a bit aggressive back at them. Sadly, it is the only language they are likely to understand. |02-02-2015|scorpio
418|You may wonder sometimes if you are in the right line of work but even if you have your doubts this is not the right time to make changes. Let the full moon’s effects subside before you give it some serious thought. |02-03-2015|scorpio
419|You may not want to do what a friend wants you to do today but if you are smart you will go along with their plans. A few days from now the roles will be reversed and you will be the one in need of support.|02-04-2015|scorpio
420|It may annoy you that some people are so slow on the uptake but not everyone can be a big-brained Scorpio like you. Make allowances today for those who don’t possess your aptitude or ability – that’s just about everyone! |02-05-2015|scorpio
421|Someone in a position of power will put you to the test today and you must raise your game and show them what you can do. There is little doubt you will win in the end, but can you do it with a smile? |02-06-2015|scorpio
422|You have been a bit too defensive of late, a bit too reserved. The good news is that with your ruler Pluto linked to Venus over the next 48 hours you can throw off your inhibitions and have the time of your life. Go for it!|02-07-2015|scorpio
423|You may have found it hard to get through to partners and loved ones in recent weeks but that’s okay. Mercury, planet of communication, moves in your favor again on Wednesday, after which you will be on the same wavelength once more. |02-08-2015|scorpio
424|Your attitude towards something will harden today and you will refuse to make changes or meet others halfway. And that’s good because the planets indicate you will only get where you want to go if you know your own mind. |02-09-2015|scorpio
425|You will have to seek assistance today from people whose knowledge is superior to your own. You can carry on alone if you like but it won’t be long before you reach a barrier you need help to get over or go around. |02-10-2015|scorpio
426|You should find it easier now to get along with people who, for one reason or another, have been a bit stand-offish of late. You will also realize that their silence was in no way a reflection on you personally. |02-11-2015|scorpio
427|Something unusual will occur today but it won’t do you any harm so long as you don’t overreact. It could be the case that someone is deliberately trying to annoy you so that you say or do something stupid – but you’re not stupid, so you won’t! |02-12-2015|scorpio
428|Information will come your way today that makes you wonder if some of the things you have been led to believe are actually true. It may upset you to discover that you have been misled but, sadly, that’s the real world.|02-13-2015|scorpio
429|Be wary of people who flatter you for no good reason. According to the planets they may be building up your reputation just so they can knock it down again. Be modest in all situations and they won’t get the chance to make you look bad.|02-14-2015|scorpio
430|In a matter of days your confidence will return and the errors of the past, such as they are, will be forgotten. Hopefully, however, you won’t forget the lessons they taught you, especially the one about not taking good luck for granted. |02-15-2015|scorpio
431|The more you are on the move over the next few days the more likely it is you will learn something to your benefit. Fate may even introduce you to someone who changes your life for the better in ways you had not expected. |02-16-2015|scorpio
432|You won’t lack for confidence today, nor for the rest of the week, but that is not an invitation to take foolish risks. When dealing with people whose motives you are not entirely sure about make certain what they say and do can’t hurt you.|02-17-2015|scorpio
433|The Sun moves into the most dynamic area of your solar chart today, marking the start of a much more upbeat phase in just about every area. Forget about what went wrong in the past – it’s the future that matters.|02-18-2015|scorpio
434|Even if you strongly disagree with what someone is doing you are advised not to make a big deal of it. It could well be the case that they are acting this way because they want to draw attention to themselves. So ignore them. |02-19-2015|scorpio
435|Certain chores may be tiresome but there is no way you can get out of them so you might as well resolve to do the best possible job. At least one person will be impressed by your efforts – and reward you in a way that you like.|02-20-2015|scorpio
436|You will work extremely hard this weekend and get twice as much done as your rivals. But are you working for yourself or are you working for someone else? Maybe you need to look at ways you can increase your independence. |02-21-2015|scorpio
437|It is essential that you start aiming higher, both in your personal life and in your career. You will never forgive yourself if you fail to do something because you fear you won’t be good enough then find later that no one is better. |02-22-2015|scorpio
438|You need to recognize that you do not have unlimited resources. If there is something you want, and it doesn’t come cheap, you may have to put it on your wait list for a while. There are more important things to spend your money on. |02-23-2015|scorpio
439|You may be tempted to rush through a task at top speed but if you do you may make a bad job of it. That means you will have to go back and do it again – and get a reputation for slapdash work. Do it right the first time.|02-24-2015|scorpio
440|If you are not feeling on top of the world right at this moment don’t worry about it because it won’t be long before your mood moves rapidly in the other direction. And don’t just tell someone you love them – show them. |02-25-2015|scorpio
441|Someone will play on your fears and make you think a certain situation is worse than it actually is. According to the planets you should reject everything you hear that makes you feel uneasy. The fact is you have little, if anything, to worry about.|02-26-2015|scorpio
442|Spend as much time as you can with loved ones today because over the weekend they will be extremely busy and you will have things to occupy you as well. It’s not about the quantity of time you spend together but the quality.|02-27-2015|scorpio
443|You will work hard this weekend, as always, but are you working towards a goal that is right for you, or one that benefits other people? It really is time to start putting your own interests first. If not now, then when?|02-28-2015|scorpio
444|You could be a bit too generous for your own good this week. Don’t offer to take on other people’s workloads just because they seem to be struggling. Maybe they are but what good does it do to have you struggle too? |03-01-2015|scorpio
445|If you need to get back on good terms with a loved one or a relative now is the time to kiss and make up. You don’t have to admit you were wrong – just let them know that your recent disagreement is well and truly forgotten. |03-02-2015|scorpio
446|If you feel the need to change the way you do things now is the time to be a bit more adventurous and try out new methods and routines. Don’t be surprised to find you have a talent for something you thought was way beyond you.|03-03-2015|scorpio
447|Make an effort to tie up loose ends today because come the weekend there will be new challenges to tackle and the last thing you want is old plans and projects holding you back. Either finish them quickly or forget them completely.|03-04-2015|scorpio
448|Something you have always taken for granted will be held up to the light of the full moon and shown to be less substantial than you imagined. Could what you thought was real be no more than a passing illusion?|03-05-2015|scorpio
449|No one can stop you today. With the Sun energizing your ruler Pluto you are the proverbial irresistible force. However, if you go too far now you may have to pay for it later, so be selective in your aims, and your methods.|03-06-2015|scorpio
450|Do something that makes a difference over the next 48 hours, something you don’t have to do but choose to do because you know it is right. Anyone can do nice things for those they love, but only special people do nice things for strangers.|03-07-2015|scorpio
451|You would no doubt be the first to admit that some of your recent efforts have not been up to your usual high standards but that’s okay. Over the next seven days you will get the chance to shine and this time you won’t let it pass by.|03-08-2015|scorpio
452|According to the planets you have become too set in your ways of late – yes, even more so than usual – and now you must loosen up a little and let other possibilities into your life. Start with your love life. Don’t be so inflexible. |03-09-2015|scorpio
453|If you focus on a problem to the exclusion of everything else you will find the solution you need. The answers you require are in your mind already and if you slow down and let your inner voice speak it will tell you what you need to hear.|03-10-2015|scorpio
454|Don’t let other people’s criticisms make you feel guilty because the planets indicate you have done nothing wrong. The main reason they are having a go at you is because they envy your abilities and want to undermine your confidence.|03-11-2015|scorpio
455|You will get what you deserve to get today, nothing more and nothing less. Now that you know that you won’t be inclined to complain if what you get falls short of expectations. The good news is you will always get another chance.|03-12-2015|scorpio
456|Mercury moves into the most dynamic area of your chart today, making it easy for you to make changes that you want to make, as opposed to changes that others want you to make. Be your own boss, and be creative too.|03-13-2015|scorpio
457|Cut back on your commitments this weekend. Let others sort things out for themselves for a change. That might sound selfish but according to the planets you are giving too much of yourself and it won’t be long before it’s all gone!|03-14-2015|scorpio
458|You may not be able to see the point in what you are being asked to do but you should do it anyway. According to the planets you have lost sight of the bigger picture but come the solar eclipse on the 20th everything will make sense again. |03-15-2015|scorpio
459|What looks simple to you may look complicated to someone else, so don’t get uptight if they can’t get their head around it. Patience may not be one of your virtues but you will need plenty of it today. What’s the rush? You’re not on the clock. |03-16-2015|scorpio
460|Something you have been working on is no longer worth the effort, so let it go. Also, when the Sun moves into the wellbeing area of your chart later this week a change of pace will be necessary. In other words: slow down!|03-17-2015|scorpio
461|The only danger today is that in your desire to prove that you can be original in your thinking you will come up with ideas that simply will not work. Others don’t admire you for your originality – they admire you for your practicality.|03-18-2015|scorpio
462|Make use of the approaching solar eclipse to get a creative project of some kind off to a flying start. If you pour energy and enthusiasm into it now you will build up the kind of momentum that carries you through to the end. |03-19-2015|scorpio
463|With the Sun moving into the work and wellbeing area of your chart today you will need to do more in some areas but do less in others. Get the balance right and follow periods of intense activity with periods of total rest. |03-20-2015|scorpio
464|You are in two minds whether or not to take a leadership position in something you have strong feelings about. Yes, it could go wrong and damage your reputation, but the fact is it is too important to be left to lesser mortals. Take control. |03-21-2015|scorpio
465|Be totally open and honest today. The planets indicate there is no reason why you should want to deceive yourself or other people. Be frank, be fearless and be the one others turn to when they want to know what is really going on. |03-22-2015|scorpio
466|Everyone seems to know what is best for you. Everyone seems to know what it is you should be doing. And everyone is wrong. Only you know what it is you desire and only you can decide on your next move. Make it a bold one. |03-23-2015|scorpio
467|With Venus, planet of harmony, moving through your opposite sign at the moment you will have to follow as much as you lead. A partnership begun now will bring advantages for both of you, so put your ego on hold. Try sharing.|03-24-2015|scorpio
468|You will be tempted to make a major decision today, even though you don’t yet know all the facts. Your impatience could pay off or it could land you in deep water – there is no way of knowing which it will be. It’s your choice. |03-25-2015|scorpio
469|You are in two minds whether to get involved in a feud that is not really any of your business but which you know you could resolve if you can only make people listen. Go on, take a chance – you might just be a hero.|03-26-2015|scorpio
470|You will go out of your way to be nice to people today – even with those who have not always been nice to you in the past. Your kindness will ripple outwards and have a positive effect on friends, friends of friends and even strangers.|03-27-2015|scorpio
471|You may be having second thoughts about something that up until now you have been hugely enthusiastic about but it does not mean you have taken a wrong turning. According to the planets it is just a passing phase – your enthusiasm will return.|03-28-2015|scorpio
472|Try not to say too much this week, especially on the work front. According to the planets a rival is hoping you will open your mouth and put your foot in it so they can have a go at you. Don’t make it easy for them.|03-29-2015|scorpio
473|It won’t be long before you look back at something that is causing you grief and realize how unimportant it was. At the moment, however, you seem to believe it is the most important thing in the world. Get over it and give yourself a break. |03-30-2015|scorpio
474|You may believe that nothing is beyond you, that you could take on the world and win, but you need to convince other people too. Channel that confidence into something constructive. There is no telling what you might accomplish today. |03-31-2015|scorpio
475|Partners and work colleagues may seem more dominant now that Mars is moving through your opposite sign, but the only power they have over you is the power that you choose to give them. What will you give them today? Nothing, hopefully.|04-01-2015|scorpio
476|You may wish that you could trade places with someone who seems to be having it easier than you at the moment but if you did you would soon realize that you have made a mistake. Chances are they envy you even more.|04-03-2015|scorpio
477|Go where your passions take you and enjoy them without feeling in the least bit guilty. That little voice inside your head may say it is wrong to be happy when so many are sad but the good thing about little voices is that they are easily ignored.|04-04-2015|scorpio
478|You need to get cracking on all the things you said you would do but somehow never quite got around to starting. Life always gives us a second chance and over the next few days new opportunities will open up for you. Take them.|04-05-2015|scorpio
479|The planets warn you are working too hard and need to change your attitude to your chores, duties and responsibilities. The fact is you will be no good to anyone if you work yourself into the ground. Lighten up – life is supposed to be fun. |04-06-2015|scorpio
480|You may find it difficult to focus over the next few days – there are too many things going on for you to concentrate on one thing for any length of time. Don’t worry: your mind will be razor sharp again come Friday.|04-07-2015|scorpio
481|What seems unimportant to you may be of earth-shattering significance to someone else, so don’t dismiss their worries out of hand. Scorpio is a Water sign and sensitive by nature, so try showing a bit of empathy over the next 24 hours.|04-08-2015|scorpio
482|You will work extremely hard over the next 24 hours – you will get twice as much done as you usually manage. But are you working for yourself or are you working for other people? Start thinking of ways you can do more for yourself.|04-09-2015|scorpio
483|Someone older and wiser will give you some valuable advice today and if you are smart you will take it. You may be doing well but you could be doing even better, so listen carefully, say thank you and apply the information they give you. |04-10-2015|scorpio
484|According to the planets someone is as infatuated with you as you are with them but, like you, they fear to be open about it because they can’t handle rejection. Make it easy for them – find subtle ways to let them know your true feelings.|04-11-2015|scorpio
485|Something unsettling is likely to happen over the coming week, most likely when your ruling planet Pluto turns retrograde on Friday. Try not to let it upset you though. In the greater scheme of things it is of relatively minor importance.|04-12-2015|scorpio
486|Your enthusiasm for your work and for life in general will impress important people today. As far as you are concerned a job worth doing is a job worth doing well but if others want to praise you for it you’re not going to complain. |04-13-2015|scorpio
487|Do you know the meaning of the word compromise? Hopefully you do because the planets warn you won’t get your way by force alone over the next 24 hours. Be willing to negotiate and be ready to give ground as well as take it.|04-14-2015|scorpio
488|Money isn’t everything but it’s still important and what happens today will remind you that you cannot afford to be too relaxed about what you own and earn. You have mouths to feed and bills to pay, so don’t waste your resources.|04-15-2015|scorpio
489|Time spent planning is rarely time wasted, so find room in your busy schedule to look ahead and plan what you are going to be doing when the Sun moves into your opposite sign next week. Make it something you can do with other people.|04-17-2015|scorpio
490|This is a good time to look back over the past few months and see how far you have come and how far you still have to go to reach your number one target. A slight adjustment may be needed to get you back on course.|04-18-2015|scorpio
491|By all means be ambitious this week but don’t let your ambitions take over your life. Personal relationships are every bit as important as professional relationships and one relationship in particular needs some extra care and attention. |04-19-2015|scorpio
492|Your instincts are telling you that a calculated risk of some kind could pay off in a big way but do you have the courage to go through with it? Only you can make that decision but make it soon or the opportunity will be gone.|04-20-2015|scorpio
493|Quite likely you will say or do something silly today but it’s no big deal. In fact it will most likely endear you to people who previously thought of you as a bit too perfect and a bit too self-controlled. Seems you’re human after all!|04-21-2015|scorpio
494|Put others first today and don’t worry if, in doing so, you fall behind in your schedule. Mercury in your opposite sign means you can easily persuade work colleagues to help you catch up later on. For now, help friends and loved ones.|04-22-2015|scorpio
495|Personal problems of one sort or another seem much bigger than they actually are at the moment and because of that you are advised to wait until the weekend before making important decisions. Most likely things are fine as they are.|04-23-2015|scorpio
496|You may have failed at something but it’s no big deal – at least you made an effort and had a go, which is more than a lot of people manage to do. The planets urge you to put the past behind you. Tomorrow promises to be bright.|04-24-2015|scorpio
497|If your current workload is proving too much for you then you must get help. The planets warn you are doing too much already and must not take on new duties or responsibilities. Get the existing stuff out of the way first. |04-25-2015|scorpio
498|Someone you are close to emotionally, a family member or a loved one, is going to make some pretty big changes over the next few days. They are more likely to be changes for the good if you encourage them and help them. Don’t be cynical. |04-26-2015|scorpio
499|You won’t hesitate to speak your mind today but be careful because certain people have got it into their head that you could do with being taken down a peg or two. Be confident but be tactful too – and never be rude.|04-27-2015|scorpio
500|With Mars moving through your opposite sign there are sure to be times when others rub you up the wrong way but you must not get aggressive in return. Give them the cold shoulder. Treat them with that icy disdain you do so well.|04-28-2015|scorpio
501|Do something special over the next 24 hours, something that those who see it never forget. That might not be as easy as it sounds, seeing as you have done so many special things in the past, but you’ll think of something!|04-29-2015|scorpio
502|You may resent having to pay for something that you feel is yours by right but don’t make an issue of it. If you kick up a fuss and manage to change things you may find others deny you in other ways, purely out of spite.|04-30-2015|scorpio
503|Mind planet Mercury moves into one of the more secretive areas of your chart today, so chances are you won’t have much to say for yourself and what you do say will be deliberately misleading. Just watch out you don’t mislead yourself.|05-01-2015|scorpio
504|Be ruthless this weekend. Have the courage of your convictions. The fact that no one else thinks you have got it right is irrelevant – it’s your call to make. If you get it right you will be a hero. If you get it wrong . . . too bad.|05-02-2015|scorpio
505|There will be a lot of tension, both at home and at work, as the new week begins but you must ignore it and focus on your objectives. You cannot stop the changes that are about to take place but you can make changes of your own. |05-03-2015|scorpio
506|A few weeks from now you will either look back and marvel at the things you accomplished or look back and regret the things you avoided. Which one it is depends entirely on you. Go on, take a chance – you know you want to. |05-04-2015|scorpio
507|If something no longer works for you the way it once did then get rid of it. That may sound ruthless but this is no time for sentiment, still less for taking risks with your long-term security. Don’t cling to the past.|05-05-2015|scorpio
508|Not even a Scorpio can get their own way all the time and you have no option now but to accept that others are calling the shots. Don’t waste time complaining. If you go along with their plans you might actually enjoy yourself.|05-06-2015|scorpio
509|The most important thing today is that you do something that makes you feel good about yourself. Also, you may need to remove yourself from an environment that reminds you of things, or people, you would prefer to forget.|05-07-2015|scorpio
510|A friend or work colleague will say something you disagree with today but if you are smart you will bite your tongue and pass up the chance to make an issue of it. Something will happen over the weekend that does your talking for you. |05-08-2015|scorpio
511|If you take too much for granted over the weekend you may end up feeling disappointed when your gains only just manage to outweigh your losses. If you come into money don’t spend any of it until you have paid off what you owe. |05-09-2015|scorpio
512|You can’t bear it when others keep secrets from you and that could be a problem this week as you seem to be the only one who does not know what is going on. Maybe it’s for the best. Maybe you would not like what you hear. |05-10-2015|scorpio
513|It’s unlikely that you will be in a sociable mood today but that’s okay because you have important things to think about and you will only do them justice if you cut yourself off from the world and spend some time alone. |05-11-2015|scorpio
514|It does not matter what you are promised or how much you are offered you must wait a few days before making any new agreements. There is no evidence that someone is trying to trick you, but neither is there any evidence they are not.|05-12-2015|scorpio
515|According to the planets there is something you have overlooked and if you want to avoid making a fool of yourself you need to find out what it is and take appropriate action. No one has noticed your mistake – yet – so get to it.|05-13-2015|scorpio
516|You may not be the most original member of the zodiac but you are certainly the most determined, so keep plugging away and don’t worry that others seem to be doing better than you. The winning post is still a long way off.|05-14-2015|scorpio
517|Try to be a bit more assertive today. Let people in positions of power know that you are not the sort of person they can kick around. You don’t have to be rude or aggressive but you do have to stand up for yourself.|05-15-2015|scorpio
518|Scorpios rarely enjoy drawing attention to themselves and that’s good because the planets warn you need to keep a low profile over the next 48 hours. There may be chaos in all directions but hopefully none of it will affect you. |05-16-2015|scorpio
519|Before you rush to rescue someone make sure they want to be rescued. In fact, make sure they are genuinely in trouble. You can do good deeds for people without being so dramatic about it. It’s the little things that mean the most. |05-17-2015|scorpio
520|Today’s new moon will bring into your sphere of contact a person who can make things happen for you. Of course, you are not obliged to accept their offer of assistance but you can sense you would be a fool not to. |05-18-2015|scorpio
521|Be careful what you ask for over the next 24 hours because, having got it, you may decide that you don’t want it after all. Not only will that be embarrassing but you may have to pay someone to come and take it away again!|05-19-2015|scorpio
522|Partnerships won’t be so intense as from this evening, which is good, but that does not mean you can ignore them altogether. In fact, joint financial ventures are still hugely important, so make sure you know what others are doing with your money!|05-20-2015|scorpio
523|You don’t have to be nice to people just because you think it is expected of you. If you don’t want to associate with certain individuals, for whatever reason, that is your right. If you don’t exercise that right you could lose it.|05-21-2015|scorpio
524|Although Venus is moving through one of the best areas of your chart you still need to be careful, especially when traveling and socializing. You may be confident that you can handle anything that comes your way but don’t tempt fate. |05-22-2015|scorpio
525|According to the planets this could be one of those weekends when you are tempted to dump your oh-so-careful nature and do something completely irrational. And why shouldn’t you? Even a Scorpio is allowed to be silly once in a while. |05-23-2015|scorpio
526|Do what you have to do and worry about the consequences later. Better still, don’t worry about the consequences at all. The most successful people in life are those who have a goal and go for it with no distractions. Be one of them.|05-24-2015|scorpio
527|If you get the chance to travel today you should take it, because later in the week your movements are likely to be restricted. You don’t need an excuse to wander around a new neighborhood – you are free to come and go as you please.|05-25-2015|scorpio
528|Someone you have to deal with today and tomorrow may seem scary but they are more afraid of you than you need be of them. You always seem so self-possessed and sure of yourself and it can be quite intimidating! |05-26-2015|scorpio
