In my last post, I made some predictions about how the focus of research in psychology might change as a function of the recent scandals that have plagued the field involving questionable research practices.  They were as follows:

 More work on lying, honesty, morality, etc.
More work with researchers as the subjects
More work with information deemed to be less slippery.

The final prediction wasn’t really about research topics, per se.  It was more a methodological point.  I suggested that we will increasingly focus on information streams which are difficult to fake or fiddle with, or are easy for other researchers to access.  For example, fewer college students, more MTurkers, more publicly available data, more intense tracking of individuals over time.  And so what does this mean for the topics we will choose to study?

Nothing.

That’s right.  There’s no reason to expect that this change in methodological approaches should lead to any change in our research interests.  Rather, we should embrace the idea that these developments should allow us to explore new territory within areas we’ve been working in all along.  Our questions are good ones - they are what define us as a science.  

However, this paradigm shift will mean that we approach them with slightly different angles.  Not only are we interested in describing and explaining behavior, but we are interested in doing so with methods that are rigorous, and *reproducible*.  This will mean different things to different areas, but it inevitably means overthrowing some psychological ‘truths’.  Some of our flimsier ideas may not stand up to this scrutiny, and that is okay.  Not just okay, but good!  If some published findings portray the world working in a particular way, but we can’t really find subsequent supporting evidence, then maybe the published findings are wrong.  Published, after all, does not mean unassailable.  Even if it was true at one point, that does not mean it will be true forever.

As scientists, we should be passionate about the questions and interested in the findings.  It is a mistake, however, to let passion creep into the the findings.  Then, we have a horse in the race, and intentionally or not, our work ends up needlessly biased.



Passion for questions vs. passion for findings.


Interested in emotional response?  No reason you shouldn’t be using experience sampling to investigate the occurrence of emotion over the course of a day.  How do affect and arousal change through the day, and how are these changes associated with the environment?  

How about intergroup interaction?  Well, groups interact all the time on the internet.  What can we do to characterize these interactions?  By ignoring them or assuming that they look just like real life interactions, we’re probably missing out on some exciting insights.  Especially ambitious would be an attempt to link behavior on the web with behavior in real life.  What sorts of carry-over effects can we find?

Or maybe you’re a memory researcher.  My PhD advisor excitingly showed that we sometimes treat computers as transactive memory systems.  However, not all computer systems are created equally.  Some methods of storing information on computers are more public than others (e.g. twitter vs. a private hard drive).  Surely there are some effects of encoding information in such a public way?  What happens to the individual who encodes a greater proportion of their information publicly?  

The point here is not 



Finally, I suggest that we will once again focus more on work which deals with ideas perceived as less slippery.  I don’t at all mean to suggest that we’ll avoid the unobservable mental states that behaviorism eschewed.  Rather, our data will come from sources which will tend to be easily verified by third parties.  This means less work inside a university lab with undergrads, and more work with data which is either readily available to others or is difficult to fake or fiddle with.  Using samples of individuals from the internet (e.g. murk), or relying on data which is sourced from the ever-expanding digital footprint we leave in our wake means that other researchers can sample the exact same populations, or access the exact same data, which should in turn lead to more reliable work.  What does this mean for research topics?  That will be covered in next week’s post.

Does this solve all the problems associated with the state that psychology finds itself in?  Of course not.  Are these approaches are not without their own sets of shortcomings.  However, this is the direction our field is going.  And although psychology is going through some rough times, it’s an exciting time to be a researcher, because these shifts promise to lead to thrilling new insights.  Here’s to hoping that soon those insights, rather than our collective misdeeds will come to dominate the news our field produces.
